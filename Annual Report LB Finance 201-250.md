<ul>
<li>The BRPTRC operates within the<br>
Charter of the Committee as approved<br>
by the Board of Directors. It includes<br>
a RPT Policy whereby the categories<br>
of persons/entities who shall be<br>

purpose of identifying parties related to<br>
them and wherever such declarations<br>

Company Secretaries. The Company<br>
Secretaries communicate any changes<br>
in the Related Parties to the officer<br>
responsible for collation of information<br>
on related parties.</li>
<li>The Company uses a RPT System that<br>
enables the Company to retrieve data<br>
on RPTs throughout the Company’s<br>
network. Based on the information<br>
as disclosed by the Directors and<br>
communicated by the Company<br>
Secretaries to the relevant officer, the<br>
database of related parties maintained<br>
in the RPT System is continuously<br>

comprehensive report every quarter/
month for Management’s review, which
is also tabled at BRPTRC meetings and
where necessary, at Board Meetings.
The said report reflects all types of
transactions with related parties
including general payments, creditors,
debtors, savings, fixed deposits and
lending.
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>In its review of RPTs, BRPTRC considers<br>
the terms and conditions of the RPT,<br>
value, and the aggregate value of<br>
transactions with the said related party<br>
during the financial year, comparison<br>
with market pricing etc. in order to<br>
determine whether they are carried out<br>
on an arm’s length basis, the disclosure<br>
requirements as per the Listing Rules<br>
of the Colombo Stock Exchange and<br>
the level of approval required for the<br>
respective RPTs are complied with.</li>
<li>The BRPTRC ensures that all<br>
transactions with related parties are in<br>
the best interests of all stakeholders,<br>
with adequate transparency in<br>
processes and are following the Listing<br>
Rules and the relevant Directions<br>
as applicable to Licensed Finance<br>

extracted at the end of each quarter /<br>
month, was presented to the BRPTRC<br>
and where necessary, to the Board at<br>
their meetings held in the immediately<br>
following month.<br>
2. All Directors made disclosures of any<br>
transactions entered/to be entered<br>
into by the respective Directors and/<br>
or any related parties of the said<br>
Director, which were minuted by the<br>
Company Secretaries. Additionally,<br>

Director of any company, the Director<br>
concerned makes a disclosure to the<br>
Board which is then captured by the<br>
Company Secretaries and passed on<br>

<pre><code>DIRECTORS’ STATEMENT ON
INTERNAL CONTROL
OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Responsibility
In line with the section 16 (1) (ix) of the
Finance Business Act Direction No. 05
of 2021 – Corporate Governance, and
Principle D.1.5 of the Code of Best Practice
on Corporate Governance 2023 issued by
Institute of Chartered Accountants of
Sri Lanka, the Board of Directors (“Board”)
of LB Finance PLC (“Company”) presents
this report on internal control over
financial reporting.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The Board has overall responsibility for
ensuring the adequacy and effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting
of the Company. The system of internal
controls is primarily designed to manage
the Company’s key areas of risk within
an acceptable risk profile, rather than to
eliminate the risk of failing to achieve the
policies and business objectives. However,
it is important to note that the system of
internal controls stipulated can provide
reasonable but not absolute assurance
against material misstatement of financial
information, records, or against financial
losses and frauds.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>In light of the above, the Board has
established a continuous process of
identifying, evaluating and managing the
significant risks faced by the Company.
This includes enhancing the system of
internal control over financial reporting,
especially when there are changes to
the business environment or regulatory
guidelines. The Board regularly reviews
this process by assessing key processes
related risks against the compensating
controls that may affect significant
accounts of the Company.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The management is tasked with assisting
the Board in the implementation of the
policies and procedures related to risks
and controls. This includes identifying
and assessing the risks faced by the
Company as well as providing inputs
on design, operation and monitoring of
internal controls over financial reporting
to mitigate and control these risks.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The Board is confident that the system of
internal control over financial reporting
is adequate to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting. This ensures that the
preparation of the financial statements
for external purposes is in accordance
with relevant accounting principles and
regulatory requirements.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Key Features of the Process Adopted
in Applying and Reviewing the Design
and Effectiveness of the Internal
Control System Over Financial
Reporting
The Company has established a
comprehensive process for reviewing the
adequacy and integrity of the system of
internal controls with respect to financial
reporting which include the following key
features:

and business directions.</li>
<li>Policies, charters, procedures are in<br>
place covering functional areas of<br>
the Company, recommended by the<br>

updates.</li>

Company monitors compliance with<br>
policies and procedures, and their<br>
suitability of design and effectiveness<br>

are highlighted. The risk-based annual<br>
audit plan is reviewed and approved<br>
by the Board Audit Committee,<br>
branches and service departments<br>
are audited to provide independent<br>
and objective assurance on operations<br>
and performance. Various initiatives<br>
have been taken by Internal Audit</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Department, business teams and other
monitoring authorities of the Company
to review the exceptions on certain
selected areas of the business through
the usage of exception monitoring
automated tools. The process has been
gradually expanded year after year to
cover an expanded scope.

<li>Information systems and its<br>
surrounding technology infrastructure<br>
which support financial reporting are<br>

<p><strong>RISKS MANAGEMENT REVIEW</strong></p>
<pre><code>RISK LANDSCAPE
Managing risk was a key priority as the
movement of key risk variables were
uncertain and risks remained elevated as
we commenced the year with significant
economic stress. The uncertainty
regarding the Domestic Debt Optimisation
was resolved by end June 2023 without
a significant impact to the stability of the
financial services sector, easing significant
stress in financial markets. Interest
rates moved down sharply with policy
rates declining by 700 basis points while
benchmark indicators such as the 364 day
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Treasury Bill Rate and Average Weighted
Prime Rate (AWPR) declined by over 1,
basis points reflecting the volatility of
key market risk drivers. Inflation which
reached 73.7% in September 2022 was
on a downward trend with targeted
monetary policy interventions and moved
from 49.2% to 2.5% during the financial
year.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>As a whole, these changes contributed to
greater economic stability by the close of
Q1 2023/24 and Sri Lanka commenced
a recovery recording positive growth
</code></pre>
<pre><code>for the next two quarters with all three
sectors of the economy contributing to
growth. A resurgence in tourist arrivals
and migrant worker remittances together
with IMF Extended Fund Facility eased
foreign exchange liquidity, supporting
appreciation of the rupee by 9%. Cautious
optimism buoyed growth in Q4 2023/
with even exports recording a sharp
increase in March 2024.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Changes in key areas impacting risk
management are set out in the table
below:
</code></pre>
<pre><code>IMPACT ON THE COMPANY STRATEGIES ADOPTED TO MITIGATE
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Volatility in Market Variables
Declining Interest Rates Downward pressure on NII due to
mismatches in rate sensitive assets
and liabilities
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Risk Level:
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Trend:
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Strategically managed the rate sensitive assets and liabilities in<br>
each repricing bucket to minimise the gap</li>
<li>Ensured timely repricing of deposit liabilities, following the<br>
market interest rate trend</li>
<li>Secured long-term low-cost funding sources at the low interest<br>
rate environment</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Volatility in Global and
Local Gold Prices
</code></pre>
<pre><code>High default risk of gold loan
borrowers and risk of higher
losses when recovering through
collateral, if price drops suddenly
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Risk Level:
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Trend:
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Promptly reacted to market price changes and maintained<br>
healthy loan to value ratio at all times</li>
<li>Further strengthened the loan loss provision allocated for gold<br>
loan exposure</li>
<li>Stress tests were carried out regularly to assess the impact at a<br>
further decline in gold prices</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Volatility in Exchange
Rate
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Possible exchange rate loss related
to repayment of foreign currency
borrowings
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Risk Level:
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Trend:
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>LBF has entered into cross currency swap, hence exchange rate<br>
risk is mitigated</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Create volatility in gold price in
local market, leading to default risk
of gold loan borrowers
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Risk Level:
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Trend:
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Closely monitored exchange rate movement and its impact to<br>
local gold price and revised the advance amount swiftly</li>
<li>Exchange rate volatility was also considered in the assessment of<br>
impairment for Gold Loan portfolio by adopting VaR methodology</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Government Policies
Continued Restrictions
on Vehicle Importation
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Less opportunities for the growth
of vehicle financing portfolio
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Risk Level:
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Trend:
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Leveraged on the lending opportunities in the registered vehicle<br>
financing category</li>
<li>Strategically enhanced the lending focus on other products such<br>
as gold backed lending, digital lending, personal financing, etc.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>IMPACT ON THE COMPANY STRATEGIES ADOPTED TO MITIGATE
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Increase in Government
taxes
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Increase in VAT created inflationary
pressure, elevating default risk
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Risk Level:
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Trend:
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Adopted sound credit risk management practices such as pre/<br>
post sanctioning of loans to mitigate the risk impact</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Regulatory Environment
Change of NPL
Definition
NPL classification was
tightened by reducing the
number of past due days from
120 to 90 days
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Deteriorating NPL ratio
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Risk Level:
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Trend:
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Strengthened the post sanction credit follow-up process to enhance
the customers repayment pattern. This enabled LBF to reduce the
NPL ratio to 3.5% by 31st March 2024, which is better than the ratio
of 4.5% reported 31st March 2023, prior to the NPL Classification
change. The current NPL ratio is well below the industry average of
17.8% as at 31st December 2023

<p><strong>RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY FRAMEWORK</strong></p>
<p>LB Finance has a comprehensive risk management policy framework which is summarised as below. All the policies set out below are<br>
approved by the Board and provides guidance to the management on implementing processes within the Company. These policies<br>
facilitate effective identification, measuring, managing, monitoring and controlling of risks faced by the Company. The policies are<br>
reviewed annually to ensure that new developments are incorporated ensuring that frameworks are robust.</p>
<p><strong>RISK APPETITE</strong></p>
<p>The Risk Appetite Statements is a key policy document, communicating to the executive function the risk boundaries within which the<br>
LBF should operate. Accordingly, the management committees, Board and Board Sub Committees initiate mitigating activities to steer<br>
key risk indicators, ensuring that the overall risk profile of LBF remains within the specified boundaries. The Risk Appetite Statement<br>
is reviewed annually by BIRMC and approved by the Board. The statement set out regulatory limits, covenant limits and internal<br>
prudential limits which are monitored on monthly basis, report to BIRMC and BOD.</p>

<pre><code>RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS
LBF’s risk management processes are all based on the following common process,
although they vary considerably across key risks. Accordingly, all material risk types,
including credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk, strategic risk, operational risk and
reputational risk are managed using the risk management process set out below.

</code></pre>
<pre><code>Risk mitigating decisions and
prompt execution
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Risk Identification
This is the process of determining current and potential risks to LBF that may stemming from internal or external environment. A
good understanding on the risk universe is vital for early identification of risk sources. During the year under review, LBF exposed
to new risks due to volatilities in the operating environment, innovations in financial offerings, process changes, etc. Given the
strong risk culture within the Company, risk identification at LBF is undertaken by employees at all levels. In the top down approach,
Company leadership/BOD perceive the emerging risks that could affect the strategic goals of LBF while in the bottom up approach, the
operational teams identify the risk sources while performing the day-today business.

<p><strong>Risk Analysis and Measurement</strong></p>
<p>This process focus on assessing the<br>
likelihood and severity of the identified<br>
risks. At LBF, a range of quantitative<br>
and qualitative tools are used for this<br>
purpose depending on the principal<br>
risk type. These include; the Risk<br>
Matrix, VaR models, Financial analysis,<br>
Maturity of Assets and Liabilities analysis,<br>
Sensitivity of Assets and Liabilities, cash<br>
flow analysis, HHI, etc. Stress impact<br>
analysis under stress circumstances is<br>
also performed on continuous basis. Risk<br>
analysis and measurement is a primary<br>
responsibility of the Risk Management<br>
Department of LBF.</p>
<p><strong>Risk Management Decision and<br>
Execution</strong></p>
<p>Risk treatment is a dynamic process<br>
where appropriate treatment<br>
methodology is selected for each<br>
assessed risk separately, to either accept,<br>
transfer, mitigate or avoid the risk. This<br>
involves redesigning of existing controls,</p>
<p><strong>OVERVIEW OF PRINCIPAL RISKS</strong></p>
<p>A summary of LBF’s principal risks are set out below reflecting their significance to the Company. A heat map of the same is presented<br>
alongside to illustrate the severity of their impact and likelihood of occurrence, relative to each other.</p>

under the guidance and oversight of<br>
the Board Integrated Risk Management<br>
Committee (BIRMC) are tasked with<br>

<strong>Risk Monitoring and Reporting</strong><br>
This process is vital to ensure the<br>
adherence to established risk control<br>
protocols and to maintain ongoing<br>
awareness of the company’s risk<br>
profile. At LBF, the quantifiable risks<br>
are monitored in comparison with<br>
the risk appetite limits. Risk Register<br>
serves as a primary document which<br>
comprehensively captures the progress<br>
of ongoing risk identification, evaluation<br>
and mitigation approaches. The Risk<br>
Management Department is charged<br>
with the responsibility of continuous risk<br>
monitoring and periodic risk reporting to<br>
the senior management, BIRMC and BOD.</p>

<p><strong>Managing Credit Risk at LBF</strong></p>
<p>The goal of credit risk management is to maximise the Company’s risk-adjusted rate of return by maintaining credit risk exposure<br>
within acceptable parameters. Credit Risk remained elevated in the first half of the financial year, easing gradually in line with<br>
economic stress.</p>
<p>The Company has a well-structured credit process that spells out the guidelines and parameters within which the Company’s credit<br>
decision process takes place. Company’s credit approval process plays the most vital role in credit risk management on a day-to-day<br>
basis. The process defines the principles about delegation of lending authority, client selection, due diligence in line with the Company’s<br>
risk appetite. Company uses various credit indicators to identify the emerging credit risks and analytical tools to manage such risks.</p>

<pre><code>The NPL ratio increased at the start of
the financial year due to a change in
the definition of NPL classification. LBF
improved the credit follow-up process
after sanction and positively affected
the repayment pattern of the customers
to reduce the NPL ratio. LBF achieved
3.5% NPL ratio by the end of the financial
year, which is considerably lower than
the industry average. The Company has
provision cover more than 100%, resulting
a net NPL ratio of -0.8% as at 31st March
2024.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>When introducing or undertaking any
new products or activities, related risk
management procedures and controls
are reviewed to ensure that any risks
arising from the proposed activity will be
within the Company risk appetite and that
processes and controls are sufficiently
robust prior to approval by the Board.
The company has a reliable management
information system that supports
credit risk monitoring across multiple
dimensions.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Credit Concentration Risk
Credit concentration risk refers to the
potential financial loss that arises from
having a large portion of credit portfolio
concentrated in a single borrower,
sector, geographic region, or type of
loan. If the concentrated segment
experiences adverse events, such as
economic downturns, industry-specific
challenges, or borrower defaults, it can
disproportionately impact the Company’s
overall financial health and stability.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>LBF has adopted an approach of
diversifying its credit portfolio across
multiple characteristics of borrowers
varying from industry sector, geography
and products. Risk appetite limits
are established to control the level
of exposure and perform continuous
monitoring of the credit portfolio ensuring
proactive risk management. Robust credit
policies and procedures are implemented
to govern lending practices and limit
exposure to high-risk segments. Regular
stress testing is conducted to evaluate
the potential impact of adverse scenarios
on the credit portfolio, helping to identify
vulnerabilities and prepare strategies to
mitigate potential losses.
</code></pre>
<h6 id="integrated-risk-management-report-7">INTEGRATED RISK MANAGEMENT REPORT</h6>
<pre><code>Exposure to top 20 customers is minimal
at 1% reflecting diversification of the
credit portfolio across borrowers.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Vehicle financing being the core product
of LBF, the concentration continued to be
weighted to lending secured by vehicles
(vehicle loans, leases and power drafts),
while there is a notable contribution from
gold loans.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The portfolio is concentrated to Western
Province due to its substantial economic
activity and high population density.
Nevertheless, it’s evident that LBF actively
operates in all provinces.

<pre><code>Liquidity Risk Management
Managed by LBF’s Treasury, the liquidity management strategy aims to ensure adequate
capital and liquidity buffers are in place to comply with the regulatory minimum
requirements under normal and stressed conditions. In this regard, LBF’s main source of
funding comes from deposit mobilisation activities. Treasury also pursues diverse funding
sources both locally and internationally to supplement the funds mobilised through
savings and deposits with institutional borrowings and other debt instruments. LBF’s Asset
and Liability Committee (ALCO) provides oversight for the proper implementation of the
liquidity strategy as set out in the Board approved Asset and Liability Management and
Liquidity Management Policy. The Contingency Funding Plan provides a framework for LBF
to evaluate increasingly severe liquidity situation and monitor the availability of funding
over these scenarios. This serves as the directive that should be followed in a stress
liquidity circumstance that disrupts day today funding of LBF.

<p><strong>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND<br>
INFORMATION SECURITY RISK</strong></p>
<p>LBF is going through a rapid<br>
digitalisation to enhance operational<br>

this digital transformation increases<br>
the InformationTechnology (IT) risks<br>
necessitating an enhancement of<br>
its IT Risk Management Framework.<br>
LBF diligently addresses these risks<br>
through the implementation of robust<br>
security control measures to mitigate<br>
cybersecurity threats.</p>
<p>Information Security risk is a key risk as<br>
LBF is a retail financial institution and<br>
maintains personal data of its customers.<br>
Accordingly, LBF is required to comply<br>
with the Personal Data Protection Act No.<br>
9 of 2022 and take steps to ensure that<br>
the information remains secure.</p>
<pre><code>LBF recognises the criticality of effectively
managing IT risks to safeguard its digital
operations. The company has implemented
a robust and proactive IT risk management
approach considering the factors such as
cybersecurity, data privacy, and operational
resilience.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Cybersecurity measures has been
achieved through multi-layered security
controls, such as firewalls, intrusion
detection systems, and encryption
mechanisms, to protect sensitive
customer data and prevent unauthorised
access. Regular security assessments,
vulnerability scanning are conducted
to identify and mitigate potential
vulnerabilities. LBF places great emphasis
on data privacy to ensure compliance
with applicable regulations and safeguard
customer information. The company
has implemented comprehensive
data protection measures, including
encryption, access controls, and robust
data storage practices. LBF began working
</code></pre>
<pre><code>on adopting mandates set out under the
Personal Data Protection Act. Further
operational resilience is a key aspect
of LBF’s IT risk management approach.
The Company has implemented robust
business continuity and disaster recovery
plans to mitigate the impact of potential
system failures, natural disasters, or other
disruptions.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Risk mitigation methodology involves
prioritising, evaluating and implementing
the appropriate risk treatment techniques
such as technical, operational and
management controls to prevent identified
risks exploiting the vulnerabilities.
This process is strengthened by the
implementation of the Company’s
Information Security Management System
(ISMS), which was established according
to the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 standard. A
comprehensive Information Technology (IT)

<pre><code>As a systemically important NBFI, LBF
enhanced its capital management
approach in 2023 by voluntarily adopting
the ICAAP recommended under Pillar 2 of
the BASEL III framework. A formal Board
approved ICAAP Policy was implemented
to guide the application of the ICAAP.
The Policy requires that integration of the
ICAAP integrated into LBF’s enterprise-
wide risk management framework and
processes to assess the effect on the
Company’s capital adequacy ratios due
to changes in risk profiles of all major risk
categories. Stress testing and scenario-
based analysis under the ICAAP are
used to assesses the capital required
under stressed conditions, ensuring the
alignment of the Company’s strategic
plan and risk management plans with the
capital plan.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Inputs from Senior Management,
Management Committees, Board
Sub-Committees and the Board are an
integral part of this iterative process.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The ICAAP working Group conducts a
quarterly ICAAP assessment and report
findings to the BIRMC and the Board for
appropriate corrective action such as
raising additional capital and/ or reduction
in exposures etc. During the year, the
ICAAP assessment was submitted to
the CBSL for its review and comments,
although there is no mandatory
requirement.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>STRESS TESTING</strong></p>
<p>Stress testing is an integral part of LBF’s Risk management process. It asses whether the company has sufficient capital and liquidity<br>
to withstand negative economic shocks. A comprehensive stress testing policy is in place that describes the purpose of stress testing,<br>
governance structure, methodology for formulating stress test frequencies and assumptions.</p>
<p>Stress testing has provided a dynamic platform to asses “What if” scenarios and to provide the company with an assessment of areas<br>
to improve.</p>
<p>During the year under review, stress scenarios were updated to be more relevant in the current economic landscape. Stress testing<br>
frequencies were increased and results were reported to the BIRMC.</p>

<p><strong>To the Shareholders of LB Finance PLC</strong></p>
<p><strong>Report on the Audit of the Financial<br>
Statements</strong></p>
<p><strong>Opinion</strong></p>
<p>We have audited the financial statements<br>
of LB Finance PLC (“the Company”) and<br>
the consolidated financial statements of<br>
the Company and its subsidiaries (“the<br>
Group”), which comprise the statements<br>
of financial position as at 31 March 2024,<br>
income statements and the statements<br>
of comprehensive income, statements of<br>
changes in equity and statements of cash<br>
flows for the year then ended, and notes to<br>
the financial statements, including material<br>
accounting policy information.</p>
<p>In our opinion, the accompanying financial<br>
statements of the Company and the Group<br>
give a true and fair view of the financial<br>
position of the Company and the Group<br>
as at 31 March 2024, and of their financial<br>
performance and cash flows for the year</p>
<pre><code>then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka
Accounting Standards.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance
with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs).
Our responsibilities under those standards
are further described in the Auditor’s
responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We are
independent of the Group in accordance
with the Code of Ethics for professional
Accountants issued by CA Sri Lanka (Code
of Ethics) and we have fulfilled our other
ethical responsibilities in accordance with
the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that,
in our professional judgment, were of most
significance in our audit of the financial
statements of the current period. These
</code></pre>
<pre><code>matters were addressed in the context
of our audit of the financial statements
as a whole, and in forming our opinion
thereon, and we do not provide a separate
opinion on these matters. For each matter
below, our description of how our audit
addressed the matter is provided in that
context.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>We have fulfilled the responsibilities
described in the Auditor’s responsibilities
for the audit of the financial statements
section of our report, including in relation
to these matters. Accordingly, our audit
included the performance of procedures
designed to respond to our assessment
of the risks of material misstatement
of the financial statements. The results
of our audit procedures, including the
procedures performed to address the
matters below, provide the basis for
our audit opinion on the accompanying
financial statements.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Allowances for Expected Credit Losses of Financial Assets
Allowances for expected credit losses of financial
assets amounting to LKR 7.3 Bn arising from loans and
receivables of LKR 168.6 Bn (Note 2.17) is determined
by the management based on the accounting policies
described in Note 2.18.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>This was a key audit matter due to
 the involvement of significant management
judgements, assumptions and level of estimation
uncertainty associated in management’s
expectation of future cash flows to recover such
financial assets; and
 the materiality of the reported amount of allowance
of expected credit losses and use of complex
calculations in its determination.
Key areas of significant judgements, assumptions and
estimates used by management included: assumed
future occurrence of events and/or transactions and
forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios and their
associated weightages, which are subject to inherently
heightened levels of estimation uncertainty.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>In addressing the adequacy of the allowances for expected credit losses of
financial assets, our audit procedures included the following key procedures:
 Assessed the alignment of the Company’s allowances for expected credit
losses computations and underlying methodology including responses to
economic conditions with its accounting policies, based on the best available
information up to the date of our report.
 Evaluated the design, implementation, and operating effectiveness of
controls over estimation of expected credit losses, which included assessing
the level of oversight, review and approval of allowances for expected credit
losses, policies and procedures by the Board and the management.
 Checked the completeness, accuracy and reasonableness of the underlying
data used in the expected credit loss computations by cross checking to
relevant source documents and accounting records of the Company.
 Evaluated the reasonableness of credit quality assessments and related
stage classifications.
 Assessed the reasonableness of the judgements, assumptions and
estimates used by the Management in assumed future occurrence of
events and/or transactions including the value and the timing of cash flow
forecasts, status of recovery actions of the collaterals, forward-looking
macroeconomic scenarios and their associated weightages.
 Assessed the adequacy of the related financial statement disclosures set out
in notes 2.17 and 2.18.

<pre><code>Other information included in the Group’s
2024 Annual Report
Other information consists of the
information included in the Annual
Report, other than the financial
statements and our auditor’s report
thereon. Management is responsible for
the other information.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Our opinion on the financial statements
does not cover the other information and
we do not express any form of assurance
conclusion thereon.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>In connection with our audit of the
financial statements, our responsibility
is to read the other information and, in
doing so, consider whether the other
information is materially inconsistent with
the financial statements or our knowledge
obtained in the audit or otherwise
appears to be materially misstated. If,
based on the work we have performed,
we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information,
we are required to report that fact. We
have nothing to report in this regard.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Responsibilities of management and those
charged with governance for the financial
statements
Management is responsible for the
preparation of financial statements that
give a true and fair view in accordance
with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards, and
for such internal control as management
determines is necessary to enable the
preparation of financial statements that
</code></pre>
<pre><code>are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>In preparing the financial statements,
management is responsible for assessing
the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters
related to going concern and using the
going concern basis of accounting unless
management either intends to liquidate
the Group or to cease operations, or has
no realistic alternative but to do so.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Those charged with governance are
responsible for overseeing the Company’s
and the Group’s financial reporting
process.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of
the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial
statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s
report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level
of assurance, but is not a guarantee
that an audit conducted in accordance
with SLAuSs will always detect a
material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or
error and are considered material if,
individually or in the aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the
basis of these financial statements.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>As part of an audit in accordance
with SLAuSs, we exercise professional
judgment and maintain professional
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>identify and assess the risks of<br>
material misstatement of the financial<br>
statements, whether due to fraud<br>
or error, design and perform audit<br>
procedures responsive to those risks,<br>
and obtain audit evidence that is<br>
sufficient and appropriate to provide<br>
a basis for our opinion. The risk of not<br>
detecting a material misstatement<br>
resulting from fraud is higher than for<br>
one resulting from error, as fraud may<br>
involve collusion, forgery, intentional<br>
omissions, misrepresentations, or the<br>
override of internal control.</li>
<li>Obtain an understanding of internal<br>
control relevant to the audit in order<br>
to design audit procedures that are<br>
appropriate in the circumstances, but<br>
not for the purpose of expressing an<br>
opinion on the effectiveness of the<br>
internal controls of the Company and<br>
the Group.</li>
<li>Evaluate the appropriateness of<br>
accounting policies used and the<br>
reasonableness of accounting<br>
estimates and related disclosures<br>
made by management.</li>
<li>Conclude on the appropriateness<br>
of management’s use of the going<br>
concern basis of accounting and,<br>
based on the audit evidence obtained,<br>
whether a material uncertainty<br>
exists related to events or conditions</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Information Technology (IT) systems related
internal controls over financial reporting.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Company’s financial reporting process is significantly
reliant on multiple IT systems and related internal
controls. Further, key financial statement disclosures
are prepared using data and reports generated by IT
systems, that are compiled and formulated with the
use of spreadsheets.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Accordingly, IT systems related internal controls
over financial reporting were considered a key audit
matter.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Our audit procedures included the following key procedures:
 Obtained an understanding of the internal control environment of the
relevant significant processes and test checked key controls relating to
financial reporting and related disclosures.
 Involved our internal specialized resources and;
 Obtained an understanding IT Governance Structure of the Company
 Identified, evaluated and tested the design and operating
effectiveness of IT systems related internal controls over financial
reporting, relating to user access and change management.
 Obtained a high-level understanding of the cybersecurity risks relevant
to the Company and the actions taken to address these risks primarily
through inquiries related to processes and controls implemented to
address cyber security risks.
 Tested source data of the reports used to generate disclosures for
accuracy and completeness.

the Group’s ability to continue as a
going concern. If we conclude that
a material uncertainty exists, we
are required to draw attention in
our auditor’s report to the related
disclosures in the financial statements
or, if such disclosures are inadequate,
to modify our opinion. Our
conclusions are based on the audit
evidence obtained up to the date of
our auditor’s report. However, future
events or conditions may cause the
Group to cease to continue as a going
concern.

fair presentation.</li>
<li>Obtain sufficient appropriate audit<br>

those charged with governance, we
determine those matters that were of
most significance in the audit of the
financial statements of the current
period and are therefore the key audit
matters. We describe these matters
in our auditor’s report unless law or
regulation precludes public disclosure
about the matter or when, in extremely
rare circumstances, we determine that
a matter should not be communicated
in our report because the adverse
consequences of doing so would
reasonably be expected to outweigh
the public interest benefits of such
communication.

<pre><code>Report on other legal and regulatory
requirements
As required by section 163 (2) of the
Companies Act No. 07 of 2007, we
have obtained all the information and
explanations that were required for the
audit and, as far as appears from our
examination, proper accounting records
have been kept by the Company.

Statements is also in compliance

in relation to the Financial
Statements, as set out in the
‘Directors’ Responsibility for
Financial Reporting, ‘Annual Report
of the Board of Directors’ and in
the statement appearing with the
Statement of Financial Position of
the Annual Report.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>1.7 Application of Sri Lanka Accounting
Standards
</code></pre>
<pre><code>1.7.1 Amendments to LKAS 08 :
Accounting Policies, Changes in
Accounting Estimates and Errors -
Definition of Accounting Estimates
The amendments clarify the
distinction between changes
in accounting estimates and
changes in accounting policies
and the correction of errors.
Also, they clarify how entities use
measurement techniques and
inputs to develop accounting
estimates. The amended standard
clarifies that the effects on
an accounting estimate of a
change in an input or a change
in a measurement technique are
changes in accounting estimates
if they do not result from the
correction of prior period errors.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>1.7.2 Amendments to LKAS 12 : Income
Taxes - Deferred Tax related to
Assets and Liabilities arising from a
Single Transaction
The amendments clarify that where
payments that settle a liability are
deductible for tax purposes, it is
a matter of judgement (having
considered the applicable tax
law) whether such deductions
are attributable for tax purposes
to the liability recognised in the
financial statements (and interest
expense) or to the related asset
component (and interest expense).
This judgement is important
in determining whether any
temporary differences exist on
initial recognition of the asset and
liability.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Also, under the amendments, the
initial recognition exception does
not apply to transactions that, on
initial recognition, give rise to equal
taxable and deductible temporary
differences. It only applies if the
recognition of a lease asset and
lease liability (or decommissioning
liability and decommissioning
asset component) give rise to
taxable and deductible temporary
differences that are not equal.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>1.7.3 Amendments to LKAS 01 :
Presentation of Financial Statements
</code></pre>
<p><strong>- Disclosure of Accounting Policies<br>
and Amendments to IFRS Practice<br>
Statement 02 - Making Materiality<br>
Judgements</strong><br>
Amendments to LKAS 01 and<br>
IFRS Practice Statement to<br>
Making Materiality Judgements,<br>
provides guidance and examples<br>
to help entities apply materiality<br>
judgements to accounting policy<br>
disclosures. The amendments aim<br>
to help entities provide accounting<br>
policy disclosures that are more<br>
useful by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replacing the requirement<br>
for entities to disclose their<br>
‘significant’ accounting policies<br>
with a requirement to disclose<br>
their ‘material’ accounting<br>
policies.</li>
<li>Adding guidance on how entities<br>
apply the concept of materiality<br>
in making decisions about<br>
accounting policy disclosures.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>1.8 Basis of Measurement

Group have been prepared on the

<p><strong>1.9 Going Concern</strong></p>
<pre><code>The Management has made
an assessment of its ability to
continue as a going concern and is
satisfied that it has the resources
to continue in business for the
foreseeable future. In making
this assessment, the Board has
considered a wide range of
information relating to present and
future conditions. The Directors
assessed the future performance
of the business and satisfied
that it has the resources in place
that are required to meet its
ongoing regulatory requirements.
The assessment is based upon
business plans which contain
future projections of profitability
as well as projections of regulatory
capital requirements and business
funding needs.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The business plan showed that
the Group had sufficient capital
in place to support its future
business requirements and
remained above its regulatory
minimum requirements in the
stress scenarios. Accordingly, the
Directors concluded that there was
a reasonable expectation that the
Group has adequate resources
to continue as a Going Concern
for a period of at least 12 months
from the date of approval of the
Financial Statements. Furthermore,
the Management is not aware of
any material uncertainties that
may cast significant doubt upon
the Group’s ability to continue as
a going concern. Therefore, the
Financial Statements of the Group
continue to be prepared on a
Going Concern basis.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>1.10 Functional and Presentation<br>
Currency</strong><br>
The Financial Statements of the<br>
Company are presented in<br>
Sri Lankan Rupees, which is the<br>
currency of the primary economic<br>
environment in which LB Finance<br>
PLC operates.</p>
<pre><code>Each entity in the Group
determines its own functional
currency and items included in
the Financial Statements of these
</code></pre>
<pre><code>entities are measured using
that Functional Currency. These
Financial Statements are presented
in Sri Lankan Rupees, the Group’s
Functional and Presentation
Currency.

<pre><code>1.11 Presentation of Financial
Statements
Assets and Liabilities of the Group
presented in their Statements of
Financial Position are Grouped by
nature and listed in an order that
reflects their relative liquidity and
maturity pattern. No adjustments
have been made for inflationary
factors affecting the Financial
Statements. An analysis on
recovery or settlement within 12
months after the reporting date

after the reporting date (non–
current) is presented in Note 3.3 on
‘Current and Non Current Analysis
of Assets and Liabilities’ to these
Financial Statements.

<pre><code>1.12 Use of Materiality, Aggregation,
Offsetting and Rounding
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Materiality and Aggregation
In compliance with Sri Lanka
Accounting Standard
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>LKAS 01 (Presentation of Financial<br>
Statements), each material class<br>
of similar items is presented<br>
separately in the Financial<br>
Statements. Items of dissimilar<br>
nature or functions too are<br>
presented separately unless they<br>
are immaterial.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Offsetting
Financial assets and financial
liabilities are offset and the net
amount reported in the Statement
of Financial Position only when
there is a legally enforceable right
to offset the recognised amounts
and there is an intention to settle
on a net basis, or to realise the
assets and settle the liability
simultaneously. Income and
expenses are not offset in the
Income Statement unless required
or permitted by an Accounting
Standard.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Rounding
The amounts in the Financial
Statements have been rounded off
to the nearest Rupees thousands,
except where otherwise indicated
as permitted by the Sri Lanka
Accounting Standard - LKAS 01.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>1.13 Comparative Information
Comparative information including
quantitative, narrative and
descriptive information is disclosed
in respect of the previous period in
the Financial Statements in order
to enhance the understanding
of the current period’s Financial
Statements and to enhance the
inter period comparability. The
presentation and classification of
the Financial Statements of the
previous year are amended, where
relevant for better presentation
and to be comparable with those
of the current year.

Statements are disclosed below.

<pre><code>1.14.1 SLFRS 17 : Insurance Contracts
SLFRS 17 is a comprehensive new
accounting standard for insurance
contracts covering recognition
and measurement, presentation
and disclosure. Once effective,
SLFRS 17 will replace SLFRS 04
