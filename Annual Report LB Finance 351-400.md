<pre><code>COLOMBO STOCK EXCHANGE (CSE)
The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE)

positive trajectory, climbing from 9,301.

notable 23.04% increase. Additionally,
the market capitalisation of the CSE grew
from Rs. 3,903.54 billion to Rs. 4,534.
billion, signifying a 16.17% rise. However,
contrasting this upward trend, the S&amp;P SL
20 index, which monitors the performance
of prominent blue-chip companies, faced
a decline, decreasing from 2,682.
points on 31 March 2023, to 3,317.
points on 31 March 2024, resulting in a
substantial 23.66% up. Moreover, the
number of listed companies experienced
a setback, diminishing from 289 at the
end of 2022/23 to 284 by the end of
2023/24. The reduction in the number
of listed companies can be attributed
to multiple factors, including the
adverse macroeconomic conditions,
political instability and the shortage
of foreign exchange throughout the
financial year. Nevertheless, the upward
movement of the ASPI index suggest an
encouraging trajectory for the economy
and demonstrates businesses’ optimism
regarding the future.

<p>Board approved whistle blowing policy is<br>
in place. Frequent awareness campaigns<br>
are conducted through various means<br>
to encourage the reporting of suspected<br>
wrongdoings, acts of corruption or<br>
breaches of anti-corruption policies. It<br>
allows for confidential and/or anonymous<br>
reporting (whistle-blowing) and there is a<br>
two-way communication with the whistle<br>
blower for any needed follow up on the<br>
disclosure.</p>
<p>The compliance officer submitted a<br>
confidential report on quarterly basis<br>
to the members of the BAC on of any<br>
whistleblowing and actions taken in<br>
compliance with the policy.</p>
<p>Quarterly awareness programmes are<br>

when they arise.</p>

<strong>corruption	policies	without	of	risk	of</strong><br>

outlines the process for reporting or<br>
raising concerns about suspected acts of<br>
corruption or violations of anti-corruption<br>
policies, ensuring that individuals can do<br>
so without fear of retaliation.</p>
<p>Few incidents have been reported for<br>
which necessary actions were taken<br>
without affecting those who reported the<br>
suspected acts.</p>
<p>The BAC remains committed to follow-<br>

would suffer demotion, penalty or other<br>
reprisals for raising concerns or reporting<br>

Regular awareness campaigns are<br>
implemented using diverse methods<br>
to promote the reporting of suspected<br>
misconduct, corruption, or violations of<br>
anti-corruption policies. These campaigns<br>
enable individuals to report confidentially<br>
