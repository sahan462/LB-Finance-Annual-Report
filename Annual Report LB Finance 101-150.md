<p><strong>OUR BRANCH NETWORK</strong></p>
<p>Our islandwide branch network comprises<br>
of 200 branches that enables us to reach<br>
over 800,000 customers across Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>We have continued to expand our<br>
branch network to extend our reach to<br>
a broader spectrum of Sri Lankans. To<br>
optimise the efficiency of these physical<br>
touchpoints, we assess customer feedback<br>
and data, including transactional status<br>
and average annual footfall at each<br>
branch location. Our primary objective<br>
is to strategically position our branches<br>
to meet the evolving needs of our<br>
customers. Consequently, through our<br>
branch relocation programme, we have<br>
relocated branches to regions with higher<br>
population density, ensuring enhanced<br>
accessibility for our customers.</p>
<p>During FY 2023/24, 02 branches were<br>
relocated to improve accessibility.<br>
Moreover, we have standardised our<br>
branches and provided training to<br>
ensure branch teams are equipped to<br>
deliver exceptional customer service.<br>
Furthermore, 08 branches were opened<br>
during the year, and over Rs. 146 Mn<br>
investment made in the branch network<br>
for FY 2023/24.</p>

<p><strong>EMPLOYEE VALUE PROPOSITION</strong></p>
<p>Our comprehensive employee value<br>
proposition is the cornerstone of our<br>
talent strategy. It not only fosters<br>
employee retention but also attracts top<br>
talent who aligns with the Organisation’s<br>
aspirations. This includes nurturing<br>
collective knowledge, ensuring employee<br>
satisfaction, and aligning individual goals<br>
with organisational objectives.</p>
<p>To strengthen our culture, we relaunched<br>
our corporate values, and clearly defined<br>
each value to guide employee behaviours<br>
and inspire them to become powerful<br>
brand ambassadors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we are in the process of<br>
implementing a recognition point scheme<br>
to reward employees who exemplify our<br>
core values in their daily work. This, along<br>
with our core value index integrated into<br>
performance evaluations, reinforces a<br>

<pre><code>HUMAN RESOURCE ACCOUNTING
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The process of measuring the worth of human capital in terms of its potential to generate future value for the Company
is known as human resource accounting, or HRA. HRA is basically the process of determining, quantifying, and
reporting on the investments in human resources that are not already taken into consideration by standard accounting
procedures. Unlike the typical accounting approach, which treats personnel costs as an expense item in the profit and
loss account, the HRA approach reports human resource-related expenditures as assets on the balance sheet.

<pre><code>FUTURE CRAFTING
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Investing in our brand of improved technologies
Our brand identity is an important component of our intellectual property and a
driving force behind our corporate plans and decisions. Our brand and ethos are
being used to get our staff and business practices into line with our brand pledge.
Our integrated stakeholder engagement approach, which is part of our broader
reputation management framework, is a key focus field. Our customer engagement
initiative, which we call our customer relationship management (CRM) approach, is
a core differentiator of our brand promise.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Our integrated stakeholder engagement approach, which is part of our broader
reputation management framework, is a key focus field. The key differentiator of
our brand promise is our approach for customer relationships management (CRM),
which we call our customer experiences programme. Our Interaction was improved
during past years and analysis into other digital tools for stakeholder interaction
ensures that we are up-to-date with state of the art technologies. Our brand
protection remains a core priority and we are committed to strong brand leadership
values, including our brand guidelines on the use of our brand, which we also cover
with external engagements.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Identify business excellence opportunities
We are still looking to improve our business procedures and functions more
effectively in order to satisfy the demands of our customers. We use business
processes and technology for business analysis to define key performance
processes that enable us to concentrate on core expertise. In addition, LBF has
developed a center of innovation and technology to supervise management
activities of business processes.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Leveraging technology in our spaces
We are committed to creativity to maximise our market worth and our stakeholders
and have thus taken the unorthodox path to our infrastructure. This ensures that
we have the freedom to take the decisions to mould our experience as desired and
still keep control of the produced results. We also wanted to follow new world class
digital platforms.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>We partner with media agencies to capitalise our room and our own screens to
achieve ‘space’ or slots on digital advertisement space. We thus build on established
ties and industrial know-how of our stakeholders while ensuring that the bulk of

<p><strong>CAPITAL REPORTS</strong></p>
<p>In our marketing communications, we<br>
enhanced the visual appeal and brought<br>
a more feel to the CIM app. Our aim is to<br>
achieve our customer reach objectives by<br>
digitising and infusing vibrancy into our<br>
communication. Accordingly, we shifted<br>
focus from product-oriented content to<br>
visually appealing material, targeting the<br>
younger demographic who will be our<br>
future customers. However, the challenge<br>
lies in striking a balance between catering<br>
to existing clients and making our content<br>
appealing to the younger generation.</p>
<p>Prominence was given to video content,<br>
particularly through a revamped TikTok</p>
<pre><code>presence. Additionally, we’ve launched
dedicated campaigns to engage our staff,
featuring their user-generated content
on our channels to foster a sense of
involvement. Furthermore, we conducted
customer polls and tracked customer
satisfaction metrics, with plans to share
KPIs internally.

<pre><code>During FY 2023/24, there were no
incidents of non-compliance concerning
marketing and communication nor
product and service information and
labelling.

<strong>Access to education</strong><br>
We advocate that quality education across all levels serves as the cornerstone for mitigating inequalities and fostering sustainable<br>
socio-economic development over the long haul. Within LBF’s CSR strategy, priority is given to enhancing educational access with the<br>
goal of eradicating the enduring knowledge gap prevalent in Sri Lanka. Additionally, as a responsible financial institution, we recognise<br>
our significant role in enhancing digital literacy among the broader community. This, in turn, fosters the development of self-sustaining<br>
communities capable of driving economic growth<br>
