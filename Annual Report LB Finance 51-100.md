<pre><code>CONTRIBUTION TO GENDER PARITY

<pre><code>CONTRIBUTING TO THE UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Global trend
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Gender parity has a fundamental bearing on whether or not economies and
societies thrive. While the representation of women in governance and in
leadership roles in the corporate sector has been increasing in recent years,
there is still a long way to go in order to achieve equality. Statistics suggest
that supporting empowerment as a general rule, corresponds with increased
numbers of women in senior roles in the labour market. Furthermore, investing
equally to develop both men and women helps to drive economies of scale and
improve future readiness of companies.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Global trend
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs) launched
by the UN in 2015 have provided a clear framework for
countries and organisations to realign their economic, social
and environmental strategies to meaningfully tackle the
most pressing sustainability challenges of our time. The
fact that the SDG’s have provided clear 2030 targets pushes
governments and corporations towards the systematic
implementation of projects at a granular level
</code></pre>
<pre><code>LBF context
</code></pre>
<pre><code>LBF’s does not discriminate on the basis of
gender or any other status protected by law.
However, a majority of the Company’s field
sales force remains largely male-dominated.
Taking proactive steps to correct this situation,
specific gender parity thresholds have been
established for every stage of the employment
lifecycle.

<pre><code>LBF contributes to the SGDs both directly and indirectly. Through
our core business of providing financial services, we support
individuals, directly enabling them to enhance their financial
stability and quality of life. By supporting businesses, LBF is
indirectly contributing to economic growth and job creation
across Sri Lanka.

<pre><code>LB FINANCE PLC’S RESPONSIBILITIES
LB Finance PLC management is
responsible for selecting the Criteria,
and for presenting the Subject Matter
in accordance with that Criteria, in all
material respects. This responsibility
includes establishing and maintaining
internal controls, maintaining adequate
records and making estimates that are
relevant to the preparation of the subject
matter, such that it is free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error.

<pre><code>Although we considered the effectiveness
of management’s internal controls when

<pre><code>A limited assurance engagement consists
of making enquiries, primarily of persons

<p><strong>Operating Context and Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The deposit base recorded healthy<br>
growth during FY 2023/24 irrespective of<br>
the decline in interest rates. Moreover,<br>
the implementation of a new tax policy<br>
by the government deterred customers<br>
from mobilising deposits by turning to<br>
alternative investments. This trend posed<br>
challenges in maintaining our deposit<br>
portfolio during FY 2023/24. Despite these<br>
challenges, our focus was on maintaining<br>
and growing our deposit base.</p>
<p>Anticipating a decline in interest rates, we<br>
exercised caution in accepting high-cost,<br>
long-term deposits, enabling a swifter<br>
downward re-pricing of the fixed deposit<br>
base as rates decreased starting in April</p>
<ol start="2023">
<li>The ad hoc policy changes posed<br>
challenges in retaining and maintaining<br>
the flow of deposits. To overcome these<br>
challenges, we customised our approach<br>
to address specific requirements, ensuring<br>
the stability of our deposit base while<br>
reducing interest costs. During periods<br>
of interest rate hikes, we introduced new<br>
deposit products to attract customers.<br>
Additionally, we concentrated on short-<br>
term deposit options, adjusting rates<br>
accordingly to align with customer<br>
preferences. Our efforts yielded positive<br>
results, recording an 81% renewal ratio.<br>
Moreover, in the declining interest rate<br>
trend during the year, we repriced our<br>
deposit base quickly responding to the<br>
market rate movements.</li>
</ol>
<p>We conducted seasonal campaigns<br>
leveraging our branch network to mobilise<br>
deposits.</p>
<p>Along with the increased trend in digital<br>
intervention to the business processes, we<br>
strategically promoted our CIM app as a<br>
convenient and accessible digital solution<br>
for deposit mobilisation. This approach<br>
leverages technology to grow our deposit<br>
base, aligning with customer preferences<br>
for a seamless and efficient financial<br>
experience.</p>
<p>In response to the challenge of staff<br>
turnover, we promoted our CIM app<br>
to encourage deposit mobilisation,<br>
leveraging its accessibility and</p>
<pre><code>convenience to grow our deposit base.
By embracing digital solutions, we
foster sustainable business practices
that streamline processes and enhance
customer engagement.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Performance
The Fixed Deposit (FD) base expanded by
7%, while including savings, the growth
reached 8%. The Fixed Deposit renewal
ratio was maintained above 75%, which
is a testament to the Company’s ability to
retain its existing customers and sustain
their trust and satisfaction over the years.
In terms of tenure, 72% of our deposits
were within the 1 month to 1-year range,
while 28% extended over 1 year to 5
years.

<pre><code>Operating Context and Strategy
The operating context in the financial
year 2023/24 improved compared to the
previous year, marked by a continued
decline in interest rates and improved
business sentiments. This shift benefited
the auto loans business, making it
more attractive, resulting in increased
volumes and improved contribution to the
Company’s bottom line.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>During the FY, we remained committed
to expanding our lending activities and
supporting our customers’ financial
needs. Our focus was on expanding our
existing portfolio with improved service
and customer-centric initiatives. Notably,
after a pause of three years, we resumed
lending to the tourism sector, placing a
greater emphasis on this industry.

<pre><code>Our credit marketing team reduced by

industry challenges stemming from the
country’s situation. Therefore, emphasis
was placed on recruitment and training,
resulting in the successful restoration
of our team. The LB Pinnacle Club was
launched to recognise top performers.
Moreover, we successfully retained our
top performers by close communication,
incentivising top performers, and
fostering a culture of excellence.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>In terms of marketing and promotions,
we sustained our annual promotions
ensuring consistency in our marketing
efforts. We invested in branding initiatives
to resonate with the improving business
sentiment, aligning our brand with the
positive economic outlook.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Performance
The Auto Loans business delivered
a commendable performance for FY
2023/24, in tandem with the improved
lending sentiments. Auto finance portfolio
increased by 14% YoY to Rs. 78.6 Bn.
from Rs. 68.9 Bn. the previous year. Auto

The recovery team demonstrated
exceptional performance, maintaining
diligent follow-up with customers
ensuring their needs were addressed
promptly. Moreover, we took proactive
measures to comply with the CBSL
regulations effective from April 2023.
Therefore, the impact on Non-Performing
Loans (NPLs) was minimal. Although there
was a slight increase in the NPL initially,
it was reduced to 3.54% by the end of
the fiscal year. We remained committed
to expanding our lending activities and
supporting our customers’ financial
needs.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Furthermore, our call centre played
a crucial role in facilitating close
coordination with various operational
departments, ensuring smooth
communication with customers and
efficient resolution of issues.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Extending Support to Our Customers
We maintained close engagement
with our customers, seeking solutions
to mitigate their losses and manage
risks. Many customers independently
found solutions to their challenges and
successfully navigated through their
difficulties. We provided the following
concessions during the year.
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Offered interest waivers and reduced<br>
rates on flexible facilities in line with the<br>
declining interest rates</li>
<li>Rebated the accumulated overdue<br>
interests</li>
<li>Provided concessions to genuine<br>
customers for settlement of facilities</li>
<li>Rescheduled facilities accommodating<br>
the financial challenges of customers</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Outlook
We will commence the ensuing FY on a
solid footing with our well-trained staff.
To streamline loan disbursement, we
will integrate the CIM app for smoother
processing. We will engage in enhancing
our brand and overall business visibility
and actively promote pension loans and
mortgage financing. Despite our current
market share standing at 12%, our goal
is to increase it by offering the most
competitive rates. We aim to maintain our
position as the market leader in terms of
value propositions and attractiveness to
customers.

<p><strong>BUSINESS REVIEW</strong></p>
<p><strong>GOLD LOANS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operating Context and Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The gold prices in Sri Lanka dropped in<br>
Q1 of FY2024 driven by a decline in global<br>
gold prices and the appreciation of the<br>
Sri Lankan rupee. This trend coincided<br>
with a negative growth in the Gold<br>
Loan portfolio of LFCs during the year.<br>
Accordingly, the Gold Loan portfolio of<br>
LFCs decreased notably from Rs. 229,800<br>
Mn in FY 2022 to Rs. 218,923 Mn in FY</p>
<ol start="2023">
<li>This was mainly due to the majority<br>
of customers moving to banks from<br>
finance companies to take advantage of<br>
the reduced interest rates during the FY<br>
under review.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this context, we focused on regaining<br>
our market share by maintaining a close<br>
relationship with our customers, adjusting<br>
their payment patterns and encouraging<br>
them to maintain interest payments to<br>
sustain their gold loan facilities. Moreover,<br>
to capture the business community,<br>
we strategically lowered our rates to<br>
be more competitive and conducted<br>
quarterly promotional campaigns tailored<br>
to their specific needs. A new product<br>
was launched targeting large ticket<br>
businesses. Furthermore, every quarter,<br>
we conducted a series of promotional<br>
campaigns targeting specific customer<br>
segments.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy to mention that we are<br>
the first finance company in Sri Lanka<br>
to launch a Gold Loan product catered<br>
for women. With 52% of our customer<br>
base comprising women entrepreneurs,<br>
engaged in home industries, the “Vanitha<br>
Ran saviya” was launched to empower<br>
women during the year.</p>
<p>Our customer experience was enhanced<br>
by conducting a raffle draw, giving away<br>
50 gold chains and bracelets to the<br>
winners, delivered to their homes. This<br>
is our second year of rewarding our<br>
customers, having gifted gold coins in the<br>
previous year.</p>
<pre><code>Performance
Through our CIM platform, we offer
unparalleled convenience to our
customers by enabling all transactions
to be conducted from the comfort of
their homes, eliminating the need to visit
a branch. Once the facility is granted,
customers need to visit the branch when
redeeming the article only. With an
average of Rs. 2 Bn. top-ups processed
through the CIM app, we have minimised
paperwork and manual work while
providing exceptional convenience.
Consequently, top-up facilities have
significantly increased YoY, reflecting
the efficiency and popularity of our
streamlined processes.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The Gold Loan portfolio increased by
10% YoY from Rs. 67 Bn. as of 31 March
2023 to Rs. 73 Bn. as of 31 March 2024.
The proportion of Gold Loans in the total
portfolio declined marginally from 46% to
45% in 2023/24.

<pre><code>MORTGAGE LOANS
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Operating Context and Strategy
The operating context was marked by
several challenges, including high-interest
rates and inflation, soaring condominium
prices, and rising building material costs.
Government regulations, particularly
income taxes, also had a significant
impact on the disposable income of
families, reducing their repayment
capacity. Consequently, the demand for
mortgage loans declined during the FY
2023/24.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>However, recognising an opportunity
among expatriates and Sri Lankans
migrating for white-collar jobs, we
strategically directed our efforts towards
this segment, as they typically had higher
rental payment capacity compared to
average earners. Moreover, we observed
a surge in demand for mortgage loans,
particularly for financing children’s
education abroad. To effectively reach
these target segments, we conducted
targeted Facebook campaigns tailored
to foreign expatriates, resulting in a
significant influx of prospective inquiries.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Our credit appraisal system implemented
a few years ago, provided invaluable
support in assessing and managing these
new demands. Additionally, to streamline

<pre><code>NPL Management
We have refined our approach to
effectively manage our NPLs. Our
primary focus now lies on small ticket
mortgages, specifically those under
Rs. 10 million. Leveraging the synergy
between our recovery team and the
marketing department, we have adopted
a collaborative strategy to expedite
the loan recovery processes. This
entails close monitoring of accounts,
proactive engagement with customers
to offer advice, and tailoring solutions to
individual requirements.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Extending Support to Our Customers
The following initiatives were
implemented to support our customers:
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Rescheduled facilities on a case-by-case<br>
basis</li>
<li>Offered sub-loans to tide over<br>
temporary cash flow issues</li>
<li>Provided rebates when settling loans to<br>
those who had financial difficulties</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Outlook
As the economic landscape shows signs of
improvement, we anticipate the economy
to return to pre-2019 levels. The growing
number of foreign income earners is
expected to contribute positively to this
trajectory. To capitalise on this trend, we
are placing greater emphasis on serving
foreign income earners and offering
tailored solutions, particularly for small-
ticket facilities. By aligning our focus
with evolving market dynamics, we aim
to optimise growth opportunities and
enhance our overall performance.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>CIM DIGITAL LOANS
Operating Context and Strategy
We introduced the CIM Business Loan
to address the needs of customers who
have been overlooked or underserved
by traditional lenders. Other service
providers often engage in selective
lending practices, coupled with
cumbersome paperwork requirements.
On the other hand, while money lenders
may offer fast service, the reliability of
loan repayment can be uncertain. In
response to these gaps in the market,
we designed the CIM Business Loan to
provide accessible, transparent, and
reliable financing solutions to a broader
spectrum of customers.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Amid the challenging business landscape
where SMEs are particularly vulnerable
and at risk of closure, we recognised
the importance of supporting them with
a cautious yet proactive approach. For
our existing customers, we conducted
thorough evaluations of their cash flows
and CRIB reports, providing tailored
advice and support throughout. Our
commitment to never letting down any of
our customers remains unwavering, as we
strive to be a reliable partner.

We maintain a low NPL ratio of 0.56%,

better communication.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Extending Support to Our Customers
To support the customers, we couldn’t
adjust the instalments directly as they are
linked to insurance coverage. However,
we implemented rate changes based on
individual customer circumstances to
reduce their overall financial burden.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Outlook
Moving forward, we aim to double
our loan volume delivering a fast and
seamless service that meets the needs and
expectations of our customers and also
driving volumes by targeting customers
who prefer using digital platforms.
</code></pre>
<p>We continued to lend to Pharmaceutical,<br>

<p>Our marketing campaigns were conducted<br>
by a team of 60 marketing officers. We<br>

</code></pre>
<pre><code>PENSION LOANS
Operating Context and Strategy
The operating context for pension loans
was challenging in the first 6 months of
the FY 2023/24, marked by increased
interest rates and limitations by the
Pensions Department on loan amounts to
60% of the pension. This led to a drastic
drop in loan volumes. The high inflation
and income losses among pensioners
also contributed to this decline. However,
in recent months, there has been a
reversal in this trend, with loan demand
increasing, reflecting improving economic
conditions and decreasing interest rates.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>During the year, we strategically targeted
acquiring new customers who had taken
loans from other banks and successfully
acquired those loans. We conducted an
SMS campaign targeting pensioners and
also sent out letters via postal mail.

<pre><code>FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS
(FC)
Operating Context and Strategy
The volatile exchange rate adversely
impacted the FC operations during
the year whilst the increase in tourist
arrivals and Sri Lankans going overseas
for employment positively impacted FC
operations in FY 2023/24.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>To mitigate the impact of volatile
exchange rates, we refrained from
stockpiling currencies and increased
the gap of buying and selling rates to
minimise potential losses. Instead, we
opted for immediate currency trading to
adapt swiftly to market fluctuations.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The 106% YoY surge in tourist arrivals led
to a 19.35% increase in foreign currency
exchange transactions. While foreign
currency operations were initially limited
to 63 branches, we are currently in the
process of expanding this service to all
branches to increase our transaction
volumes.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Additionally, we have initiated discussions
with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL)
to exchange Indian Rupees following the
permission granted by the CBSL to trade
in these currencies. This development
opens new avenues for us to diversify
our money exchange portfolio and better
serve our customers’ needs.

<pre><code>SECTION 4
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Marketing campaigns were carried out to
enhance our visibility, create customer
awareness and improve the accessibility
of our services. Visibility was improved
both internally and externally through
mediums such as A-boards, door stickers,
advertising on Monopoles, sideboards,
and LED panels. Internally, we used
backdrops and tabletops to maintain
consistent visibility.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>To foster awareness, we used SMS,
leaflets, and social media platforms.
Moreover, through strategic cross-selling
and increasing customer awareness, we
strive to continually enhance our brand
recognition and service accessibility.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Performance
The transaction volumes increased by
19.35% YoY, but the value of transactions
recorded a slight decline of 4.92% YoY,
primarily due to the decrease in the
exchange rate throughout the FY. The
exchange rate dropped from Rs. 330
to Rs. 300 by the end of the fiscal year,
impacting transaction values accordingly.

special rates, thereby capturing a larger
market share. Moreover, maintaining our
competitive exchange rates remains a
priority going forward.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>BILL PAYMENTS
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Operating Context and Strategy
During the year, we partnered with mCash
to streamline bill payments through our
platform to Western Union sub-agents
affiliated with LBF. Our objective is to
expand and enhance this initiative in the
coming years to tap into a broader market
segment. Additionally, we plan to leverage
the mCash app to facilitate insurance
payments for leasing facilities. Moreover,
customers are enabled to make bill
payments through the CIM app.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Performance
The transaction volumes increased by
57% YoY, mainly driven by the increase
in bill values. However, the value of
transactions recorded a slight decline of
4.29% YoY, primarily due to the decrease
in reload transactions.

achievers. Our aim is to achieve a
significant increase of 10,000 transactions
to reach a total of 75,000 in the ensuing
FY.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>WESTERN UNION
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Operating Context and Strategy
We continued to capitalise on our status
as a principal agent of the Western Union
money transfer network, strengthened by
the appointment of sub-agents. The LB
CIM Business Loan team also engaged in
cross-selling and raising awareness of the
LBF’s money transfer facility. Through our
remittance service, we primarily facilitate
cash transactions, enabling recipients to
collect their funds in person. However, a
decreasing trend was observed in cash
transactions. To address this trend, we are
exploring the feasibility of integrating cash
transactions into the CIM App, aligning
with evolving customer preferences and
enhancing convenience for our use.
To achieve volumes, we have assigned
staff targets with rewards. Additionally,
a customer loyalty programme was
implemented, rewarding customers based
on the value of their transactions. We
have remained committed to facilitating
cash transactions, ensuring convenience
and reliability for our customers.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Performance
The total Dollar remittances processed
through LBF’s Western Union channel
increased by an impressive 9.38%
YoY. The Rupee volume decreased
marginally by 3.12% whilst the number of

0.14% YoY.

are the essential metrics that
significantly impact the Company’s
profitability. They act like dials,
allowing the Company to fine tune
the performance by influencing the
income and expenses. These drivers
are the key factors that influence the
final result which is the Company’s
overall profitability that are broadly
categorised into five categories.

position are the underlying factors
that cause changes in the Company’s
assets, liabilities, and equity. They

To enhance the evaluation of the Company’s Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), a new dimension – Sensitivity – has been integrated
into the existing CAMEL rating system. While the traditional CAMEL framework, which analyses Capital Adequacy, Asset Quality,
Management Efficiency, Earnings and Liquidity provides insights into the Company’s financial strength and sustainable returns, it does
not fully capture the impact of market fluctuations.

<pre><code>LB Finance PLC’s financial performance over the past five years reflects a consistent growth trajectory, marked by a significant
increase in both income and profitability. The Company’s income reached a record high of Rs. 49,230 million in 2023/24, driven by
a robust 12% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) over the past five years. This growth is evident across key income streams,
including a 12% CAGR in net interest income, which reached Rs. 24,487 million in 2023/24, and a steady 13% CAGR in other
operating income. While operating expenses have shown a slight upward trend, increasing from Rs. 5,888 million to Rs. 8,670 million
over the past five years, they remain relatively stable. This controlled expense growth has contributed significantly to the impressive
growth in profitability, with profit for the year reaching a historic high of Rs. 9,564 million in 2023/24, reflecting a 17% CAGR over the
period. This consistent track record of growth underscores LB Finance PLC’s strong financial performance and its ability to navigate
market challenges effectively.
</code></pre>

years, highlighting the Company’s core focus on interest-generating activities. Meanwhile, interest expenses have gradually
declined, ranging from 48% to 29% over the same period, indicating effective management of borrowing costs. Tax on

<p><strong>FINANCIAL CAPITAL</strong></p>
<p><strong>CAPITAL REPORTS</strong></p>
<p><strong>NET INTEREST INCOME</strong></p>
<p>Net interest income recorded a<br>
growth of 28.69% Year on Year (YoY) to<br>
Rs. 24.49 billion in Financial Year (FY)<br>
2023/24 due to an increase in interest<br>
income by 15.70% YoY and a slower<br>
increase in interest expense of 3.71%.</p>
<p>The proactive repricing of interest<br>
sensitive assets and liabilities, combined<br>
with a growing lending base led to an<br>
increase in interest income during the<br>
year. Furthermore, the high interest<br>
yields on investments secured early in the<br>
financial year led to a substantial increase<br>
in investment income compared to the<br>
previous year.</p>
<p>Vehicle financing spearheaded the growth<br>
of the Company’s lending portfolio in<br>
FY 2023/24, supplemented by a moderate<br>

<p><strong>INCOME STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p>In FY 2023/24, the Company</p>
<p>profit after tax surged to Rs.</p>
<p>9.56 billion. This growth was</p>
<p>fuelled by an interest income</p>
<p>of Rs. 45.87 billion and a non-</p>
<p>interest income of Rs. 3.36</p>
<p>billion. The interest expense</p>
<p>amounted to Rs. 21.38 billion</p>
<p>whilst impairment charges</p>
<p>amounted to Rs. 373 million</p>
<p>and overhead expenses</p>
<p>totalled Rs. 8.67 billion. The</p>
<p>Company incurred a total</p>
<p>taxation of Rs. 9.25 billion.</p>
<pre><code>Following a sharp rise in interest expenses
last year due to a rapid increase in interest
rates, we observed a stabilising trend in
overall market rates during FY 2023/24.
This resulted in a marginal rise in interest
</code></pre>
<pre><code>expenses on our deposits and borrowings.
While our deposit base expanded during
the year, the impact on interest expenses
was largely offset by the downward trend
in interest rate repricing.

<pre><code>SECTION 4
</code></pre>
<pre><code>NON-INTEREST INCOME
Non-interest income comprising credit-
related fees and commissions increased
by 34.76% YoY in alignment with business
volume growth, particularly during the
second half of the financial year. This
positive trend was driven by improving
overall economic conditions. Service
charges on the other hand declined
by 6.44% due to a decline in gold loan
lending volumes compared to the
previous year.

<pre><code>IMPAIRMENT CHARGES
We made significant strides in enhancing
asset quality during FY 2023/24. The
Company allocated an impairment charge
of Rs. 373 million, reflecting a 31.61%
decrease from the previous year’s
Rs. 546 million charge.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>This improvement is particularly evident
in the impairment charge related to
loans and receivables, which declined
by 40.37% (Rs. 262 million) to reach Rs.
386.93 million. This positive development
can be attributed to a strategic shift
in the lending product mix, enhanced
credit underwriting practices, and robust
recovery efforts, all achieved despite a
challenging macroeconomic environment.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Our management maintained a vigilant
approach to credit monitoring throughout
the year, diligently managing credit risk
and prioritising asset quality improvement
through efficient management and
recovery of loans and receivables.

<pre><code>OPERATING EXPENSES
Operating expenses rose 20.78% to
Rs. 8.67 billion in FY 2023/24, compared
to Rs. 7.18 billion in the previous year.
This increase was largely driven by the
prevailing high inflationary economic
environment.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Key contributors to the rise in operating
expenses include personnel expenses
due to increases in staff training costs,
inflationary salary adjustments, and staff
incentives.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Administrative expenses encompassing
administrative, advertising and business
promotional expenses increased
compared to the previous year.

<pre><code>The horizontal analysis of LB Finance PLC’s Statement of Financial Position reveals a positive financial performance marked
by consistent growth in assets and equity over the past five years. The Company’s lending portfolio has experienced
a notable 8% CAGR, demonstrating its commitment to expanding its core business operations. This growth is further
supported by a robust 17% CAGR in internal capital generation, which has increased from Rs. 23,000 million to Rs. 43,626
million over the five years. Simultaneously, LB Finance PLC has maintained a consistent dividend policy, distributing 1/3 of its
business earnings to shareholders. While total liabilities have shown a slight increase over the past year, driven by growth in
depositor funds from Rs. 89,256 million to Rs. 122,808 million at an 8% CAGR, this growth has been at a slower pace compared
to the expansion of assets. This balanced approach to managing liabilities, coupled with consistent growth in assets and equity,
demonstrates the Company’s strong financial performance and its ability to manage its financial resources effectively.

asset and liability structure over the past five years. The analysis reveals that the majority of LB Finance PLC’s total assets
are comprised of interest earning assets, such as loans and receivables and other financial assets, consistently accounting
for between 92% and 90% of total assets. This highlights the Company’s focus on generating income through its core
lending and investment activities. On the liability side, customer deposits represent the largest source of funding, consistently
comprising approximately 61% of total liabilities, demonstrating LB Finance PLC’s commitment to prioritising customer deposits.

financial year 2019/20 to 22% in the financial year 2023/24. This upward trend in equity financing indicates a strengthening of the
Company’s capital structure and a greater reliance on internal resources to fuel growth.

compared to Rs. 145.19 billion as of

growth in gold loans, which increased
by 9.86% to reach Rs. 73.11 billion also
contributed to the lending portfolio’s

The Company demonstrated exceptional
credit quality in FY 2023/24, achieving a
gross NPL ratio of 3.54% and a negative
net NPL ratio of -0.79%. The low gross
NPL ratio highlights effective credit risk
management, while the negative net
NPL ratio signifies that provisions for
non performing loans surpass the actual
amount. These results, achieved even
under the stricter 90 day past due NPL
classification criteria implemented from
1 April 2023, showcase the Company’s
robust credit management practices
and superior asset quality compared to
industry peers.
