evolving regulatory requirements.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Environmental Management
System (EMS)
Our EMS is the foundation of our
commitment to the environment. All our
employees are encouraged to uphold
the Environmental Pledge, which reflects
our core values and guiding principles.
The EMS is dynamic, evolving to address
emerging environmental challenges while
ensuring compliance with regulations. Our
focus on addressing key environmental
issues demonstrates our commitment
</code></pre>
<pre><code>to responsible stewardship and driving
positive change. Through the EMS, we
have achieved specific achievements,
including management in carbon
emissions and the implementation of a
successful recycling programme. Through
these efforts, we cultivate a workforce of
environmentally conscious individuals,
adopt sustainable green practices, and
contribute to the conservation of our
planet for future generations.

<pre><code>EMISSION MANAGEMENT
</code></pre>
<pre><code>As a financial services institution, our direct emission (scope 1 as defined by the GHG
protocol) resulting from business activities are minimal. However, we recognise that our
responsibility extends beyond direct emission and are taking steps to address scope
2 and 3 emissions associated with our operations. We are pursuing energy efficiency
measures and exploring renewable energy options to reduce our reliance on grid
electricity, thus minimising our scope 2 emissions.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>To address scope 3 emission, we are implementing programmes to encourage employees
to adopt sustainable commuting options such as carpooling, public transportation,
cycling, and walking. We are also exploring options for remote work and flexible work
arrangements to further reduce commuting-related emission.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>While our assessments did not reveal significant air emissions or hazardous compounds,
we are committed to continuous improvement. We are exploring more comprehensive
emission measurement methodologies to further refine the understanding of our
environmental impact and identify additional areas for improvement.

<h6 id="corporate-governance">CORPORATE GOVERNANCE</h6>
<pre><code>We are pleased to state, we maintained
a steadfast commitment to upholding
transparency, accuracy, and compliance
with regulatory standards throughout the
fiscal year. Corporate governance is the
bedrock on which successful institutions
are built to last. Standing strong for over
50 years, LB Finance has continuously set
its sights beyond regulatory requirements
to uphold principles of good governance
embedded in voluntary standards and
codes of governance. This approach
has served us well, particularly as we
navigated three consecutive years of the
pandemic and the economic crisis with
resilience, honouring our commitments to
stakeholders. Building trust in the institution
is key to sustainable growth and feedback
from stakeholders serve as a barometer,
providing valuable insights on the issues
that need to be addressed.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The year under review saw the Board
of LB Finance increased our focus on
corporate governance as there were several
developments externally that needed
review and action to ensure that LB Finance
structures remain future ready and resilient.
The Colombo Stock Exchange issued a new
Listing Rules on Corporate Governance
for public listed companies and the Board
reviewed the regulation to determine gaps
and how they should be addressed. Actions
taken and plans for compliance during the
current financial year are set out in the
Corporate Governance Report that follows.
It was noted that LB Finance was compliant
with many of the requirements and needed
to address only a few areas which will be
effective from 1st October 2024 onwards,
affirming our levels of compliance.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The Institute of Chartered Accountants (CA)
of Sri Lanka also revised the Code of Best
Practice on Corporate Governance with
</code></pre>
<pre><code>changes mainly to sustainability reporting
and we have set out our compliance with
the same in this report.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The issue of the SLFRS Sustainability
Disclosure Standards in January 2024
mandating sustainability reporting
necessitates significant changes to
governance, strategy, risk management and
the metrics and targets set. As it becomes
effective for reporting period beginning
in 2025, we are commencing our journey
to complying with the requirements
proactively. I am pleased to note that the
commitment to sustainability over the
past decade has provided a head start in
meeting the requirements. We have formed
a Board Sub Committee which will have
responsibility for oversight of sustainability
related matters.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The board sub committees were active,
driving progress in their areas of oversight
and their reports are set out at the end
of the Corporate Governance report. Risk
management continues to be an important
area with significant transformations to
strengthen capabilities and processes as
many risks continue to remain volatile. The
Board Audit Committee (BAC) plays a key
role in ensuring the effective operation
of a comprehensive system of internal
controls supporting timely and reliable
financial reporting. The Board Nominations
&amp; Governance Committee (BNGC) and
the newly appointed Board Sustainability
Committee (BSC) are developing a new
agenda to steer LB Finance through
necessary changes. The Board Human
Resource and Remuneration Committee
(BHRRC) continues to play a key role in
ensuring that Directors’ remuneration and
overall remuneration policies serve the long
term interests of the company as well as
the short term. The Board Integrated Risk
Management Committee (BIRMC) continues
</code></pre>
<pre><code>to navigate LBF through an uncertain
landscape while the Board Information
Security Committee (BISC) contributes to
the highly specialised area of data and
information protection which is seeing
elevated threat levels. The Board Related
Party Transactions Review Committee
(BRPTRC) continues to ensure discharging
of their regulatory mandate, directing the
necessary communications.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The Annual General Meeting of the
Shareholders is on 28 June 2024 at the
Auditorium of the Corporate Office
and is the main platform for engaging
shareholders and notice of meeting is set
out on page 431 in this regard. We welcome
your active participation at the AGM where
the Board and I look forward to interacting
with you.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The Board is pleased to report that the
Company has applied the principles
and complied with the corporate
governance directives set out under the
Finance Business Act and the covenants
recommended in the Code of Best Practice
on Corporate Governance, issued by the
Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri
Lanka and Continuous Listing Rules on
Corporate Governance issued by Colombo
Stock Exchange (CSE). Furthermore, on
behalf of the Board, I wish to declare that
the Board of Directors, Senior Management
and employees of LB Finance PLC have
acted in good faith in conducting the affairs
of the Company.

<p><strong>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS</strong></p>
<p>As a Company engaged in the business of finance, our business license is issued by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri<br>
Lanka which also issues directions from time to time. The Board is also cognizant of the need to maintain the trust of its depositors<br>
and confidence of its borrowing customers to act in good faith as custodians of their wealth and providers of capital for their needs –<br>
in other words, maintain our social license to operate. Our governance framework is designed to ensure that these two licenses which<br>
are necessary for our continuity are maintained without any impairment. The legal enactments and regulations support our business<br>
licenses while we look to a range of voluntary frameworks and internal policies adopting best practice to support the social license as<br>
reflected in the Governance Framework. Arguably, the social license is perhaps, more fragile than the business license and the Board<br>
and the Senior Management are cognizant of this.</p>

<pre><code>Appointments &amp; Re-elections
The Board Nominations &amp; Governance
Committee plays a key role in the selection
of candidates for appointment as Directors
as they recommend candidates to the Board
for their approval. The Committee assesses
the skills, expertise and other attributes
required to meet the business needs of the
Company and seeks suitable candidates
to meet the requirements. Potential
candidates are vetted and screened against
fit and proper criteria and, in the case of
Independent Directors, criteria to determine
independence as well. Candidates who meet
the relevant criteria are recommended to the
Board for appointment.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Non-Executive Directors are appointed by
the shareholders subject to retirement and
re-elected at the Annual General Meeting.
Executive Directors are appointed by the
Board and typically serve the duration
of their employment contract. Executive
Directors who reach the age of 70 years are
re-appointed annually at the AGM subject
</code></pre>
<pre><code>to approval from CBSL. Non-Executive
Directors who hold more than 10% of
shares, directly or indirectly or appointed
to represent a shareholder who directly or
indirectly holds more than 10% may serve a
period exceeding 9 years with the approval
of the Director, Department of Supervision
of Non-Bank Financial Institutions. However,
the number of Directors exceeding 9
years cannot exceed 1/4 of the Board.
The Board also has the power to fill any
casual vacancy that may arise during the
year. In such cases, the recommendation
of the Board Nominations &amp; Governance
Committee will be vetted and approved
by the Board. Directors appointed during
the year will retire at the next AGM and are
eligible for re-election by shareholders at
the same meeting. All appointments have
to be approved by the Director, Department
of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial
Institutions. In all cases, all appointments
of new Directors are informed to the CSE
together with a brief profile of the Director,
clearly stating in what capacity the Director
has been appointed.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The election or re-election of each Director
is a separate resolution and is set out in
the Notice of Meeting on page 432 of this
report.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Retirement &amp; Resignations
Each year, 1/3 of Directors eligible for
re-election must retire with the oldest
Directors being those who retire. Such
Directors may offer themselves for re-
election by shareholders at the annual
general meeting and a separate resolution
is presented to shareholders for each
such election of a Director. Non-Executive
Directors typically retire after 9 years,
except for those holding over 10% directly
or indirectly or representing such a
shareholder. Directors may also resign
at any time by writing to the Chairman
informing him of the reasons for the
resignation and receiving formal acceptance
of the resignation subject to the approval
from Director of Department of Supervision
of Non Bank Financial Institutions. CSE
is immediately informed about the
resignations or retirements of Directors
together with their shareholding, if any, in
the Company.

the same, reviews the internal audit
reports and monitors implementation of
recommendations. BAC also conducts an

The Annual General Meeting is the main
</code></pre>
<p><strong>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE</strong></p>
<p>platform for engaging shareholders and<br>
due notice is given of the meeting in this<br>
report and as previously announced<br>
via the CSE. The feedback form which<br>
is incorporated in to the annual<br>
report serves as a key mechanism for<br>
shareholders to communicate with<br>
the company. To further strengthen<br>
the communication with shareholders<br>
and other stakeholders the Board has<br>
approved the company’s corporate<br>
communication policy. We believe the<br>
adopting a structured approach to<br>
engaging with and involving stakeholders<br>
will allow us to collaborate and learn from<br>
one another in the pursuit of mutually<br>
supportive relationships. Accordingly,<br>
the LBF Board reinforce its commitment<br>
to inclusive stakeholder engagement is<br>
based on the principles of,</p>
<ul>
<li>Relevance – focusing on those issues of<br>
material concern to our stakeholders<br>
and identifying best to address them for<br>
our mutual benefits.</li>
<li>Completeness – understanding the<br>
views, needs, performance expectations<br>
and perceptions associated with<br>
these material issues while also taking<br>
cognizance of prevailing local and global<br>
trends.</li>
<li>Responsiveness – engaging with<br>
stakeholders on these issues and giving<br>
regular, comprehensive, coherent<br>
feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SUSTAINABILITY INTEGRATION</strong></p>
<p>LB Finance has been an early champion<br>
of sustainability and has been reporting<br>
on the same, winning multiple accolades<br>
for the reports over the years both in<br>
Sri Lanka and at international award<br>
programmes. While the Board provided<br>
oversight, the mandatory reporting<br>
requirement of sustainability reporting for<br>
reporting periods commencing after 1st<br>
January 2025 makes it imperative that the<br>
reporting has the same rigour of checks<br>
and balances as the financial reporting.<br>
Accordingly, the Board appointed a new<br>
Sustainability Committee to assist the<br>
Board in this regard. A structure is now in<br>
place to steer the course to sustainability<br>
reporting in line with the SLFRS. For more<br>
information on sustainability of LBF, refer<br>

commencement of audits, the scope
of audit is reviewed by the Committee

necessary, prior to approval. Control
weaknesses highlighted in the internal
audit reports are critically examined
by the Committee. All observations are
graded into separate risk groups based
on the risk grading matrix adopted by the
company and action plans are prioritised
according to the severity. Follow up action
taken by the management on the audit
recommendations are also reviewed and
recommends re-audits where necessary,
to ensure the effectiveness of the internal
controls.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The Committee paid high level attention on
the company’s information systems and
its supporting technology infrastructure
to ascertain the adequacy of internal
controls and effectiveness and efficiency
of such investments are fulfilled while
ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and
availability of the processes supports for

independently assessed the level of
confidence in line with industry standards
such as ISO 27001:2022, COBIT, NIST,
CIS etc., and other statutory/ regulatory
directions to provide assurance at the
monthly Audit Committee meetings.

systematic examinations of exception
monitoring processes throughout the
reporting period. These evaluations
entailed meticulous reviews of financial
transactions, operational procedures,
and regulatory compliance frameworks
to detect any deviations from established
norms or potential risks. The internal
audit team has been engaged to assess
methodologies and tools for scrutinising

<pre><code>anomalies and exceptions, with the

environment and reducing potential
threats.

<pre><code>External assurance
The Committee assisted the Board by
recommending the appointment of the
External Auditor in compliance with
the relevant statutes and regulations,
the service period, audit fee and any
resignation or dismissal of the auditor.

independence, objectivity and the
effectiveness of the audit process in
accordance with applicable standards
and best practices. A written assurance
was obtained from the external
auditor confirming that they have been
independent throughout the conduct of
the audit engagement in accordance with
the terms of all relevant professional and
regulatory requirements. During the year,
the Committee has evaluated the external
auditor in line with applicable standards
and industry best practices and satisfied
with the status of the independence,
objectivity and performance of the
external auditor. The committee noted
that the current audit partner has served
in that capacity since 2023/24, whereas
the external audit firm, Messrs. Ernst &amp;
Young, has been LBF’s auditor since its
inception.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The Committee together with
management reviewed and discussed the
scope of audit, approach and audit plan
with the external auditor, Messrs. Ernst
&amp; Young, prior to the commencement
of the audit for 2023/24. The Committee
reiterated the necessity of reviewing the
compliance status on regulatory and
statutory requirements, preparation
of financial statements in conformity
with relevant accounting principles and
reporting obligations, cybersecurity
aspects and other internal control
measures.

opportunity of meeting the Committee
Members twice during the year, without

unrestricted opportunity to discuss and
express their opinions on any relevant

contained in the management letter were<br>
implemented by management.</p>

services provided by the auditor to ensure<br>
that the provision of these services<br>
does not impair their independence and<br>
objectivity. The Committee is satisfied<br>
that there is no conflict of interests<br>
between the Company and the Auditor<br>
which would hinder the independence<br>
and objectivity of the Auditor. The Policy<br>
for engaging External Auditor Non-Audit<br>
services was reviewed and approved in<br>
