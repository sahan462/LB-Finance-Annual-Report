<p><strong>1.14.2 Amendments to LKAS 01 :<br>
Presentation of Financial<br>
Statements - Classification of<br>
Liabilities as Current or Non-current</strong><br>
Amendments to LKAS 01 relate<br>
to classification of liabilities<br>
with covenants as current or<br>
non-current. The amendments<br>
clarify that if an entity’s right to<br>
defer settlement of a liability is<br>
subject to the entity complying<br>
with the required covenants<br>
only at a date subsequent to<br>
the reporting period (“future<br>
covenants”), the entity has a<br>
right to defer settlement of<br>
the liability even if it does not<br>
comply with those covenants at<br>
the end of the reporting period.<br>
The requirements apply only<br>
to liabilities arising from loan<br>
arrangements.</p>

<pre><code>1.15 Changes in Accounting
Policies
The accounting policies adopted
by the Group are consistent
with those used in the previous
financial year. Further, the
Group has not early adopted
any other accounting standard,
interpretation or amendment
that has been issued but not
effective.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>1.16 Significant Accounting Assumptions,
Judgments and Estimation
Uncertainties
The preparation of Financial
Statements of the Group in
conformity with Sri Lanka
Accounting Standards requires
the management to make
assumptions, judgments
and estimates that affect the
application of accounting policies
and the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, income and
expenses. Due to the inherent
uncertainty involved with
estimates, actual results may differ
from these estimates.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Estimates and underlying
assumptions are reviewed on
an ongoing basis. Revisions
to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which
the estimate is revised and in any
future periods affected.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The most significant areas of
estimation uncertainties, critical
judgments and assumptions in
applying accounting policies that
have most significant effect on
the amounts recognised in the
Financial Statements of the Group
are as follows;
1.23 Impairment of Non Financial
Assets
1.24 Estimating the Incremental
Borrowing Rate
2.10 Taxation
2.13 Classification of Financial
Assets and Liabilities
2.14 Fair Value of Financial

</code></pre>
<p><strong>1.17 Basis of Consolidation</strong></p>
<pre><code>The Group’s Financial Statements
comprise, Consolidated Financial
Statements of the Company and
its Subsidiaries in terms of the
Sri Lanka Accounting Standard -
SLFRS 10 (Consolidated Financial
Statements).
</code></pre>
<pre><code>1.17.1 Non-Controlling Interest
Details of Non-Controlling Interest
are given in Note 2.37 to these
Financial Statements.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>1.17.2 Investment in Subsidiaries
Details of the Company’s
subsidiaries are set out in Note 2.
to these Financial Statements.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>1.17.3 Loss of Control
When the Group losses control
over a subsidiary, it derecognises
the assets and liabilities of the
subsidiary, and any related
Non-Controlling Interest and
other components of equity. Any
resulting gain or loss is recognised
in Income Statement. Any interest
retained in the former subsidiary
is measured at fair value when
control is lost. Subsequently, it is
accounted for as an Associate or
in accordance with the Group’s
Accounting Policy for financial
instruments depending on the
level of influence retained.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>1.17.4 Transactions Eliminated on
Consolidation
Intra-group balances, transactions
and any unrealised income and
expenses (except for foreign
currency transaction gains or
losses) arising from intra-group
transactions are eliminated in
preparing the Consolidated
Financial Statements. Unrealised
gains arising from transactions
with equity accounted investees
are eliminated against the
investment to the extent of the
Group’s interest in the investee.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in
the same way as unrealised gains,
but only to the extent that there is
no evidence of impairment.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>1.18 Foreign Currency
</code></pre>
<pre><code>1.18.1 Foreign Currency Transactions and
Balances
Foreign currency transactions
are translated into the functional
currency, which is Sri Lankan
Rupees, using the exchange rates
prevailing at the dates of the
transactions. In this regard, the
Company’s practice is to use the
</code></pre>
<pre><code>middle rate of exchange ruling at
the date of the transaction.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies
as at the reporting date are
translated into the functional
currency at the middle exchange
rate of the functional currency
ruling as at the reporting date. The
foreign currency gain or loss on
monetary items is the difference
between amortised cost in the
functional currency as at the
beginning of the year adjusted for
effective interest and payments
during the year and the amortised
cost in foreign currency translated
at the exchange rate as at the
reporting date.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Non-monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies
that are measured at fair value
are translated into the functional
currency at the spot exchange
rate at the date that the fair value
was determined. Non-monetary
items that are measured in terms
of historical cost in a foreign
currency are translated using the
exchange rate as at the date of the
transaction.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Foreign currency differences
arising on translation are generally
recognised in Income Statement.
However, foreign currency
differences arising from the
translation of available for sale
equity instruments are recognised
in Other Comprehensive Income.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>1.18.2 Foreign Currency Translations
The Group’s Consolidated Financial
Statements are presented in Sri
Lankan Rupees, which is also the
Company’s functional currency.
The Financial Statements of the
foreign operations of the Company
have been translated into the
Group’s presentation currency
as explained under Note 1.18.
below.

<h3 id="section-6-1">SECTION 6</h3>
<pre><code>currency are translated into the
Company’s presentation currency
as follows;
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Assets and liabilities, including
goodwill and fair value
adjustments arising on acquisition,
are translated at the rates of
exchange rates ruling as at the
reporting date.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Income and expenses are
translated at the average
exchange rate for the period,
unless this average rate is not a
reasonable approximation of the
rate prevailing at the transaction
date, in which case income and
expenses are translated at the
exchange rates ruling at the
transaction date.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>All resulting exchange differences
are recognised in the Other
Comprehensive Income and
accumulated in the Foreign
Currency Translation Reserve,
which is a separate component
of Equity, except to the extent
that the translation difference is
allocated to the Non-Controlling
Interest.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>When a foreign operation is
disposed of such that the control is
lost, the cumulative amount in the
translation reserve related to that
foreign operation is reclassified
to Income Statement as part of
the gain or loss on disposal. If
the Group disposes of only part
of its interest in a subsidiary that
includes a foreign operation while
retaining control, then the relevant
proportion of the cumulative
amount of the translation reserve
is reattributed to Non-Controlling
Interest.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>1.19 Provisions</strong></p>
<pre><code>A provision is recognised if, as a
result of a past event, the Group
has a present legal or constructive
obligation that can be estimated
reliably, and it is probable that an
outflow of economic benefits will
be required to settle the obligation.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The amount recognised is the
best estimate of the consideration
</code></pre>
<pre><code>required to settle the present
obligation at the reporting date,
taking into account the risks and
uncertainties surrounding the
obligation at that date. Where a
provision is measured using the
cash flows estimated to settle the
present obligation, its carrying
amount is determined based on
the present value of those cash
flows. A provision for onerous
contracts is recognised when the
expected benefits to be derived
by the Group from a contract are
lower than the unavoidable cost
of meeting its obligations under
the contract. The provision is
measured as the present value of
the lower of the expected cost of
terminating the contract and the
expected net cost of continuing
with the contract.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Before a provision is established,
the Group recognises any
impairment loss on the assets
associated with that contract. The
expense relating to any provision is
presented in the Income Statement
net of any reimbursement.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>1.20 Operational Risk Events
Provisions for operational risk
events are recognised for losses
incurred by the Group which do
not relate directly to amounts of
principal outstanding for loans and
advances. The amount recognised
as a provision is the best estimate
of the expenditure required to
settle the present obligation as
at the reporting date, taking into
account the risks and uncertainties
that surround the events and
circumstances that affect the
provision.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>1.21 Borrowing Costs
As per the Sri Lanka Accounting
Standard – LKAS 23 (Borrowing
Costs), the Group capitalises
borrowing costs that are directly
attributable to the acquisition,
construction or production of a
qualifying asset as part of the cost
of the asset. A qualifying asset is
an asset which takes a substantial
period of time to get ready for
its intended use or sale. Other
</code></pre>
<pre><code>borrowing costs are recognised
in the Income Statement in the
period in which they occur.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>1.22 Financial Guarantees and Loan
Commitments
Financial guarantees are contracts
that require the Group to make
specified payments to reimburse
the holder for a loss that it incurs
because a specified debtor
fails to make payment when it
is due in accordance with the
terms of a debt instrument.
Loan commitments are firm
commitments to provide credit
under pre-specified terms and
conditions.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Loan commitments at below
market interest rates drawdown
are initially measured at fair value
and subsequently measured at the
higher of the amount of the ECL
allowance and the amount initially
recognised less, when appropriate,
the cumulative amount of income
recognised.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The nominal contractual value
of financial guarantees, letters
of credit and undrawn loan
commitments, where the loan
agreed to be provided is on
market terms, are not recorded
in the Statement of Financial
Position.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Loan types with undrawn limits are
expected to change the exposure
over a period due to the available
portion in the unutilised limit.
The drawdowns for unutilised
portions (only for Stage 01 and 02)
are considered by applying the
behavioral (average) use of the
facility over the given period and
current excess over the average
(positive net exposure).Then the
positive net exposure is classified
as 12 month or lifetime expected
credit loss.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Details of commitments and
contingencies are presented
in Note 3.5 to these Financial
Statements.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>1.23 Impairment of Non Financial Assets
The Group assess at each
reporting date whether there is
an indication that an asset may
be impaired. If any indication
exists, or when annual impairment
testing for an asset is required,
the Group estimates the asset’s
recoverable amount. An asset’s
recoverable amount is the higher
of an asset’s or Cash Generating
Unit’s (CGU’s) fair value less costs
to sell and its value in use. Where
the carrying amount of an asset
or CGU exceeds its recoverable
amount, the asset is considered
impaired and is written down to its
recoverable amount.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>In assessing value in use, the
estimated future cash flows
are discounted to their present
value using a pre–tax discount
rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of
money and the risks specific to the
asset. In determining fair value
less costs to sell, an appropriate
valuation model is used. These
calculations are corroborated
by valuation multiples, quoted
share prices for publicly traded
subsidiaries or other available fair
value indicators.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>For assets excluding goodwill,
an assessment is made at each
reporting date as to whether there
is any indication that previously
recognised impairment losses
may no longer exist or may have
decreased. If such indication exists,
</code></pre>
<pre><code>the Group estimates the asset’s
or CGU’s recoverable amount. A
previously recognised impairment
loss is reversed only if there has
been a change in the assumptions
used to determine the asset’s
recoverable amount since the last
impairment loss was recognised.
The reversal is limited so that the
carrying amount of the asset does
not exceed its recoverable amount,
nor exceeds the carrying amount
that would have been determined,
net of depreciation, had no
impairment loss been recognised
for the asset in prior years. Such
reversal is recognised in the
Income Statement. A previously
recognised impairment loss in
respect of goodwill is not reversed.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>1.24 Estimating the Incremental
Borrowing Rate
Further, as the Group cannot
readily determine the interest
rate implicit in the lease, it uses its
Incremental Borrowing Rate (IBR)
to measure the lease liabilities. The
IBR is the rate of interest that the
Group would have to pay to borrow
over a similar term, and with a
similar security, the funds necessary
to obtain an asset of a similar value
to the right-of-use asset in a similar
economic environment. The IBR
therefore reflects what the Group
‘would have to pay’, which requires
estimation when no observable
rates are available (or when they
need to be adjusted to reflect the
terms and conditions of the lease).
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The Group estimates the IBR using
observable input when available
and is required to make certain
entity-specific adjustments.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>1.25 Other Taxes
</code></pre>
<pre><code>1.25.1 Withholding Tax (WHT) on Dividends
Withholding Tax arises from the
distribution of dividends by the
Company and is recognised at
the time the liability to pay the
related dividend is recognised. The
prevailing WHT rate on dividends
distributed by the Company to
shareholders is 15%. Dividend paid
by the Company will be exempt in
the hands of shareholders to the
extent that such dividend payment
is attributable to, or derived from
dividend received by the Company
from another resident Company.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>As per the Inland Revenue
(Amendment) Act No. 45 of 2022,
WHT on dividends was introduced
effective from 01 January 2023.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>1.25.2 Value Added Tax (VAT)
The VAT rate had been increased
from 15% to 18% with effect from
01 January 2024. Further, goods
and services which were previously
exempt from VAT became liable at
the rate of 18% with effect from 01
January 2024.

<p><strong>2.1 Net Interest Income</strong></p>
<pre><code>Accounting Policy
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be
reliably measured. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The Group use the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method for recognising the interest income and interest expenses of financial
assets and financial liabilities that are measured at amortised cost, fair value through profit or loss or fair value through other
comprehensive income under SLFRS 09. EIR is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts
through the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the
financial asset or financial liability.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The calculation of EIR takes into account all contractual terms of the financial instrument and includes any fees or incremental
costs that are directly attributable to the instrument and are an integral part of the EIR, but not future credit losses.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability is adjusted if the Group revises its estimates of payments or
receipts. The adjusted carrying amount is calculated based on the original EIR and the change in carrying amount is recorded as
an impairment charge or reversal to the Income Statement.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Once the recorded value of a financial asset or a Group of similar financial assets has been reduced due to an impairment loss,
interest income continues to be recognised, using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of
measuring the impairment loss. Recognition of interest income is ceased when one or more of the criteria set out in Note 2.
is present for a financial asset. More information on interest cessation is discussed in Note 2.18 to these Financial Statements.
Interest from overdue rentals have been accounted for on a cash received basis.

<p><strong>2.6 Personnel Expenses</strong></p>
<pre><code>Accounting Policy
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Personnel Expenses include salaries and bonus, terminal benefits and other staff-related expenses. The provision for bonus
is recognised when it is probable that an outflow of resource embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the
obligation and a reliable estimate can be made on the amount of the obligation.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Defined Contribution Plans - Employees’ Provident Fund and Employees’ Trust Fund - LB Finance PLC and Multi Finance PLC</strong></p>
<pre><code>A defined contribution plan is a post employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate
entity (a fund) and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient
assets to pay all employee benefits relating to employee services in the current and prior periods as defined in the Sri Lanka
Accounting Standard - LKAS 19 (Employee Benefits).
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The contribution payable to a defined contribution plan is in proportion to the services rendered to the Company by the
employees and is recorded as an expense when they become due. Unpaid contributions are recorded as a liability.
The Company and the employees contribute 12% and 8% respectively on the salary of each employee to the Employees’
Provident Fund.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The Company contributes 3% of the salary of each employee to the Employees’ Trust Fund.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Defined Contribution Plans - Social Security Fund - LB Microfinance Myanmar Company Limited
The Company and the employees contribute 3% and 2% respectively on the salary of each employee to the Social Security
Board. The maximum contribution is limited to Myanmar kyat 9,000/- by the Company and Myanmar kyat 6,000/- by the
employee.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Defined Benefit Plans - LB Finance PLC and Multi Finance PLC
A defined benefit plan is a post employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. Accordingly, staff gratuity was
considered as defined benefit plan as per Sri Lanka Accounting Standard - LKAS 19.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Day 01 Loss on Staff Loan

Depreciation is calculated to write-off the cost of items of property, plant and equipment less their estimated residual values
using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives and is recognised in the Income Statement. Freehold land is not
depreciated.

<pre><code>Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the useful lives of the assets. However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the
Group will obtain the ownership by the end of the lease term, the assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated
useful lives and the lease terms as defined in Note 2.23.

<pre><code>2.10 Taxation
Accounting Policy
</code></pre>
<pre><code>As per Sri Lanka Accounting Standard - LKAS 12 (Income Taxes), tax expense is the aggregate amount included in determination
of profit or loss for the period in respect of current and deferred taxation. Income tax expense is recognised in the Income
Statement except to the extent it relates to items recognised directly in ‘Equity’ or ‘Other Comprehensive Income (OCI)’, in which
case it is recognised in Equity or in OCI.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Current Taxation
Current tax assets and liabilities consist of amounts expected to be recovered from or paid to the Commissioner General of
Inland Revenue in respect of the current year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of prior years. The tax rates and
tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date. Accordingly,
provision for taxation is based on the profit for the year adjusted for taxation purposes in accordance with the provisions of
the Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017 and the amendments thereto at the rates specified in Note 2.10.3 to these Financial
Statements.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Provision for taxation on the overseas operations is made on the basis of the accounting profit for the year, as adjusted for
taxation purposes, in accordance with the provisions of the relevant statutes in those countries, using the tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted as at the reporting date.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Accounting Estimates
Significant judgment was required to determine the total provision for current and deferred taxes. Uncertainties exist, with
respect to the interpretation of the applicability of tax laws, at the time of the preparation of these Financial Statements. The
Group recognised assets and liabilities for current and deferred taxes based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be
due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences
will impact the income and deferred tax amounts in the period in which the determination is made.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities
Detailed disclosure of accounting policies and estimate of deferred tax is available in Note 2.26 to these Financial Statements.

<pre><code>2.11 Earnings Per Ordinary Share
Accounting Policy
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The Group presents Basic and Diluted Earnings per Share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic earnings per share is
calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by weighted average number of ordinary
shares outstanding during the year, as per the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard - LKAS 33 (Earnings Per Share).
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to the ordinary shareholders and the weighted average
number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares, which comprise share options
granted to employees. The Group does not have any potentially dilutive shares.

<h3 id="section-6-8">SECTION 6</h3>
<p><strong>2.13 Financial Instruments</strong></p>
<pre><code>Accounting Policy
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Date of Recognition
Financial assets and liabilities, with the exception of loans and advances to customers and balances due to depositors, are
initially recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the
instrument. This includes regular way trades, purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the
time frame generally established by regulation or convention in the market place. Loans and advances to customers are
recognised on the date on which it originated. The Group recognises balances due to depositors when funds are transferred to
the Group.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Classification and Initial Measurement of Financial Instruments
The classification of financial instruments at initial recognition depends on their contractual terms and the business model
for managing the instruments. A financial asset or financial liability is measured initially at fair value plus or minus transaction
costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue, except in the case of financial assets and financial liabilities at
fair value through profit or loss as per Sri Lanka Accounting Standard - SLFRS 09 (Financial Instruments). Trade receivables of
subsidiaries are measured at the transaction price. When the fair value of financial instruments at initial recognition differs
from the transaction price, the Group accounts for the Day 01 profit or loss.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Day 01 Profit or Loss
When the transaction price of the instrument differs from the fair value at origination and the fair value is based on a valuation
technique using only inputs observable in market transactions, the Group recognises the difference between the transaction
price and the fair value in net trading income. In those cases where fair value is based on models for which some of the inputs
are not observable, the difference between the transaction price and the fair value is deferred and is only recognised in profit
or loss when the inputs become observable, or when the instrument is derecognised.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Classification and Subsequent Measurement of Financial Assets
As per SLFRS 09, the Group classifies all of its financial assets based on the business model for managing the assets and the
assets’ contractual terms measured at either;
</code></pre>
<pre><code> Amortised Cost
 Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI)
</code></pre>
<pre><code> Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVPL)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Business Model Assessment
Group determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages the financial assets to achieve its objectives.
The Group’s business model is not assessed on an instrument by instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated
portfolios and is based on observable factors such as;
</code></pre>
<pre><code> How the performance of the business model and the financial asset held within that business model are evaluated and
reported to the entity’s key management personnel
</code></pre>
<pre><code> The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and,
in particular, the way those risks are managed
</code></pre>
<pre><code> How managers of the business are compensated (for example, whether the compensation is based on the fair value of the
assets managed or on the contractual cash flow collected)
</code></pre>
<pre><code> The expected frequency, value and timing of sales
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking ‘worst case’ or ‘stress case’
scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Group’s original
expectation, the Group does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that business model, but
incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased financial assets.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Contractual Cash Flow Characteristic Test (The SPPI Test)
As the second test of the classification process, the Group assesses the contractual terms of the financial asset to identify
whether those meet ‘Solely the Payment of Principal and Interest’ (SPPI) criteria.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Principal for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition which may change
over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation of the premium/discount).
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The most significant elements of interest within a lending arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of
money and credit risk. To make SPPI assessment, the Group applies judgment and considers relevant factors such as currency
in which the financial asset is denominated and the period for which the interest rate is set.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Classification and Subsequent Measurement of Financial Liabilities
As per SLFRS 09, the Group classifies financial liabilities, other than financial guarantees and loan commitments into one of the
following categories;
 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and within this category as;
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Held for trading; or</li>
<li>Designated at fair value through profit or loss</li>
</ul>
<pre><code> Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Reclassification of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
As per SLFRS 09, Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except and only in those rare
circumstances when the Group changes its objective of the business model for managing such financial assets which may
include the acquisition, disposal or termination of a business line.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Financial liabilities are not reclassified as such reclassifications are not permitted by SLFRS 09.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Derecognition of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a Group of similar financial assets) is derecognised
when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset have expired.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Modification of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
If the terms of a financial asset are modified, an assessment needs to be performed to determine whether the modified terms
are substantially different from the existing terms. This assessment considers whether the cash flows of the modified asset
are substantially different. Where terms are substantially different, the existing financial asset will be derecognised and a new
financial asset will be recognised at fair value. Where terms are not substantially different, then the modification does not
result in derecognition of the financial asset.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms or the terms
of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original
liability and the recognition of a new liability. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at
fair value.

<pre><code>2.14 Fair Value Measurement
Accounting Policy
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset
or transfer the liability takes place either:
 In the principal market for the asset or liability; or
 In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the
asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non financial
asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use
or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. The Group uses various valuation
methodologies that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available to measure fair value, maximising
the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. The use of observable and unobservable
inputs and their significance in measuring fair value are reflected in our fair value hierarchy assessment.
Level 1 : Inputs include quoted prices for identical instruments.
Level 2 : Inputs include quoted prices for similar instruments and observable inputs such as interest rates, currency exchange
rates and yield curves.
Level 3 : Inputs include data not observable in the market and reflect management judgement about the assumptions market
participants would use in pricing the instruments.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Valuation Framework
The Company has an established control framework for the measurement of fair values. Finance Department is responsible for the
valuation of financial instruments. Obtaining input data, valuing of financial instruments and verifying the valuation models are being
segregated within the Finance Department.
We review the inputs to the fair value measurements to ensure they are appropriately categorised within the fair value hierarchy.
Transfers into and transfers out of the hierarchy levels are recognised as if they had taken place at the end of the reporting period.

<pre><code>Valuation Methodologies and Assumptions
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Included in cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and
which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate, quoted price, or penalty on withdrawal. A debt
security is classified as a cash equivalent if it meets these criteria and if it has a remaining time to maturity of three months or
less from the date of acquisition. Amounts on deposit and available upon demand, or negotiated to provide for daily liquidity
without penalty, are classified as cash and cash equivalents. Time deposits and money market accounts that meet the above
criteria are reported at par value on our Statement of Financial Position.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Loans and Receivables
We measure performing loans and receivables at fair value for purposes of disclosure using internal valuation models. These
models project future cash flows of financing contracts based on scheduled contract payments (including principal and
interest). The projected cash flows are discounted to present value based on assumptions regarding credit losses, prepayment
speed, and applicable spreads to approximate current rates. Our assumptions regarding prepayment speed and credit losses
are based on historical performance. We use the fair value of collateral to determine the fair value of non-performing loans and
receivables. The collateral for loans and receivables is the vehicle financed, real estate, gold or other property. The fair value
of loans and receivables is categorised within Level 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy. Loans and advances granted to
customers with a variable rate are considered to be carried at fair value in the books net of credit losses.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Other Financial Assets
Since all the balances which are under other financial assets have short-term maturities, it is assumed that the carrying
amounts of those balances approximate their fair values except for Investment in Treasury Bills.

<pre><code>There were no transfers into and transfers out of the hierarchy levels during 2024 and 2023.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Valuation Methodologies and Assumptions</strong></p>
<pre><code>Due to Depositors
We measure the fair value using internal valuation models. These models project future cash flows of fixed deposits based on
scheduled maturities (including principal and interest) and pre-maturities of deposits. The projected cash flows are discounted
to present value based on applicable spreads to approximate current deposit rates for each tenor. Our assumptions regarding
pre-maturity speed and spreads are based on historical performance. Savings deposits without a specific maturity are assumed
that the carrying amounts approximate their fair values. The fair value of Due to Depositors is categorised within Level 3 of the
hierarchy.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Debentures, Bank Borrowings and Debt Instruments
We measure fair value for listed debentures using quoted prices for our own debentures with approximately the same
remaining maturities, where possible. If the particular debenture is off the run, we estimate the fair value using discounted
cash flows and market-based expectations for interest rates, credit risk, and the contractual terms of the debenture.
Comparable on the run debenture Yield to Maturity (YTM) assumed to be a good approximation for the fair value estimation
of off the run debentures. We estimate the fair value of bank borrowings and debt instruments using discounted cash flows
and use the most recent transacted rate and/or unexpired offered rate of a similar instrument or borrowing. Debt instrument
and bank borrowing do not carry prepayment or embedded options. The fair value of debt is categorised within Level 2 of the
hierarchy.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Other Financial Liabilities
Since all the liabilities which are under other financial liabilities have short-term maturities, it is assumed that the carrying
amounts of those liabilities approximate their fair values.

<p><strong>2.16 Financial Assets Recognised Through Profit or Loss - Measured at Fair Value</strong></p>
<pre><code>Accounting Policy
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The Group classifies financial assets as financial assets recognised through profit or loss when they have been purchased primarily
for short-term profit making through trading activities. Financial assets recognised through profit or loss are recorded and measured
in the Statement of Financial Position at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognised in net trading income.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Financial assets recognised through profit or loss include quoted equity securities that have been acquired principally for the
purpose of selling in the near term, and are recorded at fair values. The quoted equity securities are valued using the market
prices published by the Colombo Stock Exchange.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>SLFRS 09 requires financial instruments to be classified based on a combination of the entity’s business model for managing
the assets and the instruments’ contractual cash flow characteristics. For financial assets that are debt instruments, held for
trading is a business model objective that results in measurement at fair value through profit or loss.

<pre><code>2.17 Financial Assets at Amortised Cost - Loans and Receivables
Accounting Policy
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Loans and receivables include financial assets measured at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met;
 Assets that are held within a business model whose objective is to hold the assets in order to collect contractual cash flows.
 Contractual terms of the assets give rise on specific dates to cash flows that are solely payment of principal and interest on
the principal outstanding.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>After initial measurement loans and receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR),
less allowance for impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees
and costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The amortisation is included in ‛interest income’ in the Income Statement. The losses
arising from impairment are recognised in ‛impairment charges’ in the Income Statement.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Lease Receivables
Agreements which transfer to counterparties substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of assets, but
not necessarily legal title, are classified as finance leases. When the Group is the lessor under finance leases the amounts due
under the leases, after deduction of unearned income, are recognised on the Statement of Financial Position. The finance
income receivable is recognised in ‛interest income’ over the periods of the leases so as to give a constant rate of return on the
net investment in the leases.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Operating Lease
All other leases are classified as operating leases. When acting as lessor, the Group includes the assets subject to operating
leases in ‘property, plant and equipment’ and accounts for them accordingly. Impairment losses are recognised to the extent
that residual values are not fully recoverable and the carrying value of the assets is thereby impaired.

<pre><code>2.18 Allowance for Impairment Losses
Accounting Policy
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Overview of the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) Principles
The adoption of SLFRS 09 has fundamentally changed the Group’s loan loss impairment method by replacing LKAS 39’s
incurred loss approach with a forward-looking Expected Credit Loss (ECL) approach. From 1 April 2018, the Group has been
recording the allowance for expected credit losses for all loans and other debt financial assets not held at Fair Value Through
Profit or Loss (FVPL), together with loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts, in this section all referred to as
‛financial instruments’. Equity instruments are not subject to impairment under SLFRS 09.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The 12 months ECL is the portion of Lifetime ECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial
instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Both Lifetime ECLs and 12 months ECLs are calculated on either an individual basis or a collective basis, depending on the
nature of the underlying portfolio of financial instruments.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The Group has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial
instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default
occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. Based on such process Group allocates loans into Stage 01,
Stage 02, Stage 03 as described below;
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Stage 01
When loans are first recognised, the Group recognises an allowance based on 12 months ECLs. Stage 01 loans also include
facilities where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 02.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Stage 02
When a loan has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Group records an allowance for the Lifetime
ECLs. Stage 02 loans also include facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 03.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Stage 03
When a loan is considered to be credit impaired/contain objective evidences of incurred loss, the Group records an allowance
for the Lifetime ECLs.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Definition of Default and Credit Impaired Assets
The Group considers loans and advances to customers be defaulted when the borrower is unlikely to pay its obligations to the
Group in full, without recourse by the Group to actions such as realising security (if any is held) or the borrower becomes 90
days past due on its contractual payments.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Significant Increase in Credit Risk
The Group continuously monitors all assets subject to ECL, in order to determine whether there has been a significant increase
in credit risk since initial recognition and whether the instrument or a portfolio of instruments is subject to 12 months ECL or
Lifetime ECL. The Group considers an exposure to have a significant increase in credit risk at 30 days past due.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Individually Significant Impairment Assessment and Loans which are Not Impaired Individually
Group will individually assess all significant customer exposures to identify whether there are any indicators of impairment.
Loans with objective evidence of incurred losses are classified as Stage 03. Loans which are individually significant but not
impaired will be assessed collectively for impairment under either Stage 01 or Stage 02, based on the above specified criteria to
identify whether there have been a significant credit deterioration since origination.
</code></pre>
<h2 id="notes-to-the-financial-statements-15">Notes to the Financial Statements</h2>
<h1 id="section-678">1 2 3 4 5 6 7</h1>
<h3 id="section-6-17">SECTION 6</h3>
<pre><code>While establishing significant credit deterioration, Group will consider the following criteria;
 Other changes in the rates or terms of an existing financial instrument that would be significantly different if the instrument
was newly originated.
</code></pre>
<pre><code> Significant changes in external market indicators of credit risk for a particular financial instrument or similar financial
instrument.
</code></pre>
<pre><code> Other information related to the borrower, such as changes in the price of a borrower’s debt/equity instrument.
 An actual/expected internal credit rating downgrade for the borrower or decrease in behavioural score used to assess credit
risk internally.
</code></pre>
<pre><code> Existing or forecasted adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant
change in the borrower’s ability to meet its obligation.
</code></pre>
<pre><code> An actual or expected significant change in the operating results of the borrower in relation to actual/expected decline in
revenue, increase in operating risk, working capital deficiency, decrease in asset quality, increase in gearing and liquidity
management problems.
 Significant increase in credit risk on other financial instruments of the same borrower.
</code></pre>
<pre><code> An actual or expected significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic or technological environment of the borrower
that results in a significant change in the borrower’s ability to meet the debt obligation.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Grouping Financial Assets Measured on a Collective Basis</strong></p>
<pre><code>As explained above, Group calculates ECL either on a collective or individual basis. Asset classes where Company calculates ECL
on an individual basis includes all individually significant assets which belong to Stage 03. All assets which belong to Stage 01
and 02 will be assessed collectively for impairment.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The Group allocates smaller homogeneous exposures based on a combination of internal and external characteristics such as
product type, line of business, customer type, days past due etc.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Calculation of ECL</strong></p>
<pre><code>The expected cash shortfalls are calculated by multiplying respective loan level PDs, EADs and LGDs. The cash shortfall is
discounted to the Effective Interest Rate (EIR). A cash shortfall is the difference between the cash flows that are due to an entity
in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the entity expects to receive.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>PDs and LGDs are adjusted to the forward looking information using statistically quantified variance.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The mechanics of the ECL calculation are outlined below and the key elements are as follows;
 Probability of Default (PD) : PD is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. Hence majority of our
client base being retail; we use internal information to estimate the PDs. The client has two credit statuses which can be
identified as default or not default. We used Cohort Method (CM) to compute the PDs.
</code></pre>
<pre><code> Exposure at Default (EAD) : EAD is the estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected
changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of the principal and interest, whether scheduled by
contract or otherwise and expected draw downs on committed facilities.
</code></pre>
<pre><code> Loss Given Default (LGD) : LGD is an estimate of the loss arising, where a default occurs at a given time calculated based on
historical recovery data. It is usually expressed as percentage of the EAD.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>For all products, Group considers the maximum period over which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a
financial instrument.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The published global financial sector credit rating migration matrix Probability of Default used for fixed income (bank deposits)
securities expected loss calculation, Value at Risk Methodology (VAR) is used for gold based loan expected loss calculation. Any
financial asset, fully secured through a cash collateral, has not taken into the expected loss calculation.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Forward Looking Information
Company relies on broad range of qualitative/quantitative forward looking information as economic inputs in the multiple
economic factor model developed to forecast the expected Non-Performing Loans (NPL).
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The model predicts the forward industry NPL levels and which has been used to adjust the Company PD curve using statistically
quantified variance. The economic factor model is developed by the University of Colombo, Science and Technology CELL and
consent to use with an annual review. The economic factor model uses the machine learning technique to predict the NPL
based on the use of some key economic factors as an input to the model. The key variables of the model is as follows;
</code></pre>
<pre><code> Industry NPL  Per Capita GDP  Business Confidence Index  Unemployment Rates
 Balance of Payment  Exchange Rates  Budget Deficit as a Percentage of GDP  Fuel Prices
 GDP Growth Rate  Interest Rates  Inflation Rates  Rainfall
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Reversals of Impairment
If the amount of an impairment loss decreases in a subsequent period, and the decrease can be related objectively to an event
occurring after the impairment was recognised, the excess is written back by reducing the financial asset impairment allowance
account accordingly. The write-back is recognised in the Income Statement.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Write-off of Loans and Receivables
Financial assets and the related impairment allowance accounts are generally written-off when there is no realistic prospect of
recovery. Where financial assets are secured, this is generally after receipt of any proceeds from the realisation of security.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Collateral Valuation
Revaluation of immovable properties obtained as collaterals against any accommodation granted are assessed based on the
requirements in the Direction No. 04 of 2018 on ‛Valuation of Immovable Properties’ and subsequent amendments thereto
issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL). The assessment of immovable properties is carrying out by independent
professional valuers as required by the said direction issued by CBSL.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The assessed fair value of the immovable properties does not consider for the measurement of regulatory provisions for bad
and doubtful debts as per Direction No. 01 of 2020 and subsequent amendments thereto issued by CBSL.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Collateral Repossessed
Repossessed collateral will not be taken into books of accounts unless the Group has taken those collaterals into its business
operations. However such additions from the repossessed collaterals to the business operations are not significant.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Non-Accrual Receivables
Cessation of Interest income recognition is triggered out when the receivables are more than 90 days past due, receivables are
subject to legal action/ongoing legal action, receivables are subject to untraceable or unattainable collaterals, or receivables
are determined to be uncollectible. For receivables in non-accrual status, subsequent financing revenue is recognised only to
the extent a payment is received. Payments are generally applied first to outstanding interest and then to the unpaid principal
balance.

<p><strong>2.18.7 Sensitivity Analysis of Allowance for Impairment Losses</strong></p>
<pre><code>The Company has estimated the impairment provision as at 31 March 2024 based on various assumptions. The changes
to such assumptions may lead to changes in the impairment provision recorded in the Statement of Financial Position. The
sensitivity of the impairment provision of the Company as at 31 March 2024 to a reasonably possible change in Probability of
Defaults (PDs) and Loss Given Defaults (LGDs) are demonstrated in the following table. The simulated Expected Credit Loss
impacts of the multiple scenarios based on forward looking macroeconomic information are presented in the Note 2.18.8 to
these Financial Statements.

</code></pre>
<p><strong>2.18.8 Measurement Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analysis of ECL Estimates</strong></p>
<pre><code>The recognition and measurement of ECL involves the use of significant judgement and estimation including estimation of
Probabilities of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), a range of unbiased future economic scenarios, estimation of expected
lives, estimation of Exposures at Default (EAD) and assessing significant increases in credit risk. This becomes more complex,
particularly in times of economic volatility and uncertainty. The Group form multiple economic scenarios based on economic
forecasts to estimate future credit losses and to determine an unbiased ECL estimate. Management judgements are used to
address the data and model limitations and expert credit judgements.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Methodology
The Group have been used three scenarios at multiple confidence levels to capture the exceptional nature of the current
economic environment and to simulate management’s view of the range of potential outcomes. The range of forecasts are
generated through the model due to the uncertainty caused by current adverse economic conditions. These three scenarios
are drawn from the model developed by the Company with Colombo Science and Technology CELL of University of Colombo.
The model uses multiple economic variables like GDP, unemployment, inflation, and trained to identify the historical
correlations. The impact arising from the upside, downside and base scenarios have been simulated through a machine
learning technique.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Economic forecasts are subject to a high degree of uncertainty in the current environment. Limitations of forecasts and
economic models require a greater reliance on management judgement in addressing both the error inherent in economic
forecasts and in assessing associated ECL outcomes.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>ECL Scenarios and Sensitivity Analysis of Allowance for Impairment Losses
As expected, the scenarios create differing impacts on ECL and the impacts are deemed reasonable. In this simulation, it is
assumed that existing modelled relationships between key economic variables and loss drivers hold, but in practice other
factors would also have an impact, for example, potential customer behaviour changes and policy changes by lenders that
might impact on the wider availability of credit.

<pre><code>Scenario Analysis
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Base Scenario
Economic Factor Adjustment (EFA) model of the Company features a decrease in non-performing advances in 2025 and 2026
according to the Base Scenario in line with the improving macroeconomic conditions. This results in a positive impact of 31.29%
and positive impact of 35.15% in the year 2025 and 2026, respectively.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Despite the sharp contraction in economic activities, the measures from Government and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka
including tightening the policy interest rates, debt restructuring and measures for funding markets supported the economy and
the financial system. Such support ensures economic activities will improve in long term. In addition, the proposed changes
to fiscal policies and government finances mark a significant step forward in strengthening the economy and will ease the
pressure on budget deficit, interest rates and exchange rates. We expect proposed changes and developments to contribute
positively on recovery prospects.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Upside Scenario
Compared with the Base Scenario, the Upside Scenario features a faster recovery in economic activities during the first two
years and beyond. These include the timely implementation of proposed changes which will strengthen the overall economy,
speedy recovery of all the industries that were affected by the adverse macroeconomic conditions. The Upside Scenario
expects a significant decrease in the EFA 58.27% and 72.75% respectively in the first two years at confidence level of 99% which
declines when the confidence level move downwards.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Downside Scenario
In the Downside Scenario, economic recovery is considerably weaker compared with the Base Scenario. GDP growth remains
weak, unemployment rates stay highly elevated and asset and commodity prices fall before gradually recovering towards their
long-run trends. The Downside Scenario expects a marginal decrease in the EFA 4.73% in year 1 and slight increase in the EFA
2.96% in year 2 and above at 99% confidence level. The slow recovery expects the EFA to be improve gradually over the next
two years.

<p><strong>Management Judgemental Adjustments</strong></p>
<pre><code>Management judgemental adjustments are short-term increases or decreases to the ECL at either a customer or portfolio level
to account for late-breaking events, model and data limitations and deficiencies, and expert credit judgement applied following
management review and challenge.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Given the degree of uncertainty surrounding the adverse economic conditions and the lack of reliable data to model the impact
on portfolio, as well as the operational and timing challenges in incorporating the latest available macroeconomic inputs into
the ECL models, it was necessary to place greater emphasis on judgemental adjustments to modelled outcomes than past few
years. We have developed a consistent methodologies for the application of management judgemental adjustments into the
calculation of ECL. These management judgemental adjustments made are described below.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The Company decided to use the downside scenario at 95% confidence level when assessing the economic factor adjustments
with the objective of capturing the impact of uncertainties in the future outlook on the ECL computation as at the reporting
date. Further judgement was used to take an additional stress on the economic factor adjustment as a prudential measure due
to the nature and the complexity of current economic conditions.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Business conditions were continued to deteriorate during the first half of the financial year and a gradual improvement
was observed towards the latter part of the financial year. Industries that were severely affected by the economic downturn
followed by the pandemic is still in the phase of recovery and those industries do not automatically trigger in additional
consideration of ECL through the model. The Group judged that the portfolios concentrated in tourism, transport and
construction sectors require further judgement in previous financial years and continued those sectors for further judgement
due to the much slower pace of improvement in economic conditions during the current financial year. Thus, credit impaired
PDs were applied for the facilities where the credit risk has not significantly increased or credit impaired under the tourism,
transport and construction sectors.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>2.19 Financial Assets Measured at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income</strong></p>
<pre><code>Accounting Policy
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Upon initial recognition, the Group occasionally elects to classify irrevocably some of its equity investments as equity
instruments at FVOCI when they meet the definition of Equity under Sri Lanka Accounting Standard - LKAS 32 (Financial
Instruments: Presentation) and are not held for trading. Such classification is determined on an instrument-by instrument
basis.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Gains and losses on these equity instruments are never recycled to Income Statement. Dividends are recognised in the Income
Statement as other operating income when the right of the payment has been established, except when the Group benefits
from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the instrument, in which case, such gains are recorded in Other
Comprehensive Income. Equity instruments at FVOCI are not subject to an impairment assessment.

<p><strong>2.22 Investment in Subsidiaries</strong></p>
<pre><code>Accounting Policy
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Subsidiary is an investee controlled by the Group. The Group ‛controls’ an investee if it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable
returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The Group reassesses whether it has control if there are changes to one or more of the elements of control. This includes
circumstances in which protective rights held (e.g. those resulting from a lending relationship) become substantive and lead to
the Group having power over an investee.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The cost of an acquisition is measured at fair value of the consideration, including contingent consideration. The acquired
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Subsequent to
the initial measurement the Company continues to recognise the investments in subsidiaries at cost.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The Financial Statements of Subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date on which control
commences until the date when control ceases.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The Financial Statements of the Subsidiaries in the Group have a common financial year which ends on 31 March. The Financial
Statements of the Company’s subsidiaries are prepared using consistent accounting policies.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>All intra-group balances, transactions, unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group transactions, income and
expenses are eliminated in full.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the Subsidiary to transfer funds to the Parent (the Company) in the form of
cash dividend or repayment of loans and advances.

<pre><code>In furtherance of the Financial Sector Consolidation Plan of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, the Boards of Directors of LB Finance
PLC and its subsidiary, Multi Finance PLC, have resolved to amalgamate Multi Finance PLC with LB Finance PLC under Section
239 of the companies Act No.07 of 2007, whereby LB Finance PLC will be the Amalgamated Company, subject however to the
regulatory approvals and the approval of the shareholders of both Multi Finance PLC and LB Finance PLC, by way of Special
Resolutions at Extraordinary General Meetings of the respective companies.
As per the annual impairment test performed for the investment in subsidiaries, the Group considered the progress of
the amalgamation process and the net book value of the investment among other factors, when reviewing indicators of
impairment as at 31 March 2024. The market price was not available since the trading of shares of Multi Finance PLC was
suspended from 13 October 2022.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The recoverable amount of the investment in Multi Finance PLC as at 31 March 2024 has been determined based on a value
in use calculation using cash flow projections. It was concluded that the fair value less costs to sell did not exceed the value in
use. As a result of this analysis, management has recognised an impairment charge of Rs. 223 Mn in the current financial year
against the investment in subsidiaries as at 31 March 2024. The amount recognised is recorded within impairment charges in
the Income Statement.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>2.23 Property, Plant and Equipment and Right-of-Use Assets
Property, plant and equipment are tangible items that are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for
rental to others or for administrative purposes and are expected to be used for more than one year. The Group applies the
requirements of the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard - LKAS 16 (Property, Plant and Equipment) in accounting for these assets.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Accounting Policy
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Basis of Recognition
Property, plant and equipment are recognised if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow
to the Group and the cost of the asset can be reliably measured.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Measurement
An item of property, plant and equipment that qualifies for recognition as an asset is initially measured at its cost. Cost includes
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset and cost incurred subsequently to add, replace part
of, or service it. The cost of self constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly
attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use and the costs of dismantling and removing the
items and restoring the site on which they are located. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related
equipment is capitalised as part of computer equipment.
</code></pre>
<h2 id="notes-to-the-financial-statements-21">Notes to the Financial Statements</h2>
<h1 id="section-684">1 2 3 4 5 6 7</h1>
<h3 id="section-6-23">SECTION 6</h3>
<p><strong>Cost Model</strong></p>
<pre><code>The Group applies cost model to property, plant and equipment and records at cost of purchase or construction together with
any incidental expenses thereon less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Such cost includes
the cost of replacing part of the equipment when that cost is incurred, if the recognition criteria are met.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Subsequent Cost
The subsequent cost of replacing a component of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying
amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within that part will flow to the Group and its
cost can be reliably measured. The costs of day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are charged to the Income
Statement as incurred. Costs incurred in using or redeploying an item is not included under carrying amount of an item.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Derecognition
The carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic
benefits are expected from its use or disposal. The gain or loss arising from derecognition of an item of property, plant and
equipment is included in the Income Statement when the item is derecognised.
When replacement costs are recognised in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment, the remaining
carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. Major inspection costs are capitalised. At each such capitalisation, the
remaining carrying amount of the previous cost of inspections is derecognised.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Right-of-Use Assets
Right-of-use assets are presented together with property, plant and equipment in the Statement of Financial Position. Right-of-
use assets of the Group include land and buildings under long term rental agreements for its use as offices and branches.
The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the date of commencement of the lease, which is the present value of lease
payments to be made over the lease term. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and
impairment losses and adjusted for any re-measurement of lease liabilities. The cost of the right-of-use assets includes the
amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct cost incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement
date less any lease incentives received.
Right-of-use assets are amortised on the straight line basis over the lease term.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Depreciation
The Group provides depreciation from the date the assets are available for use up to the date of disposal, at the following rates
on a straight line basis over the periods appropriate to the estimated useful lives, based on the pattern in which the asset’s
future economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the Group. Depreciation of an asset ceases at the earlier of the date
that the asset is classified as held for sale or the date that the asset is derecognised. Depreciation does not cease when the
assets become idle or is retired from active use unless the asset is fully depreciated. Freehold land is not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives of the property, plant and equipment of the Company as at 31 March 2024 are as follows;
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Asset Category Period
(Years)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Depreciation
% per Annum
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Freehold Buildings and Edifices 50 2%
Furniture and Fittings 4-6.67 15-25%
Equipment 4-5 20-25%
Motor Vehicles 5-8 12.50-20%
Computer Hardware and Equipment 4-5 20-25%
Improvement of Leasehold Asset 6.67 15%
Fixtures and Fittings 4-5 20-25%
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The above rates are compatible with the rates used by all Group entities.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Accounting Estimates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Useful Lifetime of the Property, Plant and Equipment</strong></p>
<pre><code>The Group reviews the residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment at each
reporting date. Judgment of the management is exercised in the estimation of these values, rates, methods and hence they are
subject to uncertainty.
