<pre><code>2.24 Investment Properties
Accounting Policy
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Basis of Recognition
Investment properties are those which are held either to earn rental or for capital appreciation or for both, but not for sale in
the ordinary course of business, use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes.
An investment property is recognised, if it is probable that future economic benefits that are associated with the investment
property will flow to the Group and cost of the investment property can be reliably measured.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Basis of Measurement
Fair Value Model
Investment properties are initially recognised at cost. Subsequent to initial recognition, the investment properties are stated at fair
value, which reflect market conditions at the reporting date. Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value and the rental income
from the investment property is recognised under other operating income in the Income Statement in the year in which they arise.
Where Group companies occupy a significant portion of the investment property of a subsidiary, such investment properties
are treated as property, plant and equipment in the Consolidated Financial Statements, and accounted for as per Sri Lanka
Accounting Standard - LKAS 16 (Property, Plant and Equipment).
</code></pre>
<h1 id="section-1">1 2 3 4 5 6 7</h1>
<h3 id="section-6-1">SECTION 6</h3>
<pre><code>Derecognition
Investment properties are derecognised when either they have been disposed of or when the investment property is permanently
withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from its disposal. Any gains or losses on the retirement or disposal
of an investment property are recognised in the Income Statement in the year of retirement or disposal.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Subsequent Transfers to/from Investment Properties
Transfers are made to investment properties when, and only when, there is a change in use, evidenced by the end of owner
occupation, commencement of an operating lease to another party or completion of construction or development.
Transfers are made from investment properties when, and only when, there is a change in use, evidenced by commencement
of owner occupation or commencement of development with a view to sale.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>For a transfer from investment properties to owner occupied property or inventories, the deemed cost of property for
subsequent accounting is its fair value at the date of change in use. If the property occupied by the Group as an owner
occupied property becomes an investment property, the Group, accounts for such property in accordance with the policy
stated under property, plant and equipment up to the date of change in use.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>For a transfer from inventories to investment properties, any difference between the fair value of the property at that date
and its previous carrying amount is recognised in the Income statement. When the Group completes the construction or
development of a self constructed investment property, any difference between the fair value of the property at that date and
its previous carrying amount is recognised in the Income Statement.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Determining Fair Value</strong></p>
<p>External and independent professional valuers, having appropriate recognised professional qualifications and recent experience<br>

<p><strong>2.25 Intangible Assets</strong></p>
<pre><code>An intangible asset is an identifiable monetary asset without physical substance held for use in the production or supply
of goods or services, for rental to others or for administrative purposes. The Group’s intangible assets include the value of
acquired goodwill and computer software.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Accounting Policy
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Basis of Recognition</strong></p>
<pre><code>An intangible asset is recognised if it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to
the entity and the cost of the assets can be measured reliably. An intangible asset is initially measured at cost.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following
initial recognition, these assets are stated in the Statement of Financial Position at cost, less accumulated amortisation and
accumulated impairment losses, if any.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Subsequent Expenditure</strong></p>
<pre><code>Expenditure incurred on intangible assets is capitalised only when it is probable that this expenditure will enable the asset to
generate future economic benefits in excess of its originally assessed standard of performance and this expenditure can be
measured and attributed to the asset reliably. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Derecognition of Intangible Assets</strong></p>
<pre><code>The carrying amount of an item of intangible asset is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are
expected from its use. The gain or loss arising from derecognition of an item of intangible asset is included in the Income
Statement when the item is derecognised.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Useful Economic Lives, Amortisation and Impairment of Intangible Assets</strong></p>
<pre><code>Intangible assets, except for goodwill, are amortised on a straight line basis in the Income Statement from the date when the
asset is available for use, over the best estimate of its useful economic life based on a pattern in which the asset’s economic
benefits are consumed by the Group. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortised, but are tested for impairment
annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the asset may be impaired. Only finite-lived intangible asset is
computer software of the Group. Goodwill is the indefinite-lived intangible asset which is subject to annual impairment test.
Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate. The
Group assumes that there is no residual value for its intangible assets.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Computer Software</strong></p>
<pre><code>Cost of all computer software licensed for use by the Group, which are not integrally related to associated hardware, which
can be clearly identified, reliably measured and it’s probable that they will lead to future economic benefits, are included in the
Statement of Financial Position under the category of intangible assets and carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and
any accumulated impairment losses.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Useful lifetime of computer software is as follows;
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Intangible Asset Category Period (Years) Depreciation % per Annum
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Computer Software 3-5 20-33.33%
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition of a subsidiary or an associate over the Group’s interest in the net
fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. Carrying amount of goodwill that arises on the acquisition of
subsidiaries is presented with intangible assets.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Goodwill is initially measured at cost and subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated
impairment losses.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Impairment Testing on Goodwill
The Group tests the goodwill for impairment annually and assess for any indication of impairment to ensure that its carrying
amount does not exceed the recoverable amount. If an impairment loss is identified, it is recognised immediately to the Income
Statement. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date,
allocated to Groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other
assets prorata to the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Where goodwill forms part of a cash generating unit and part of
the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying
amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.

<pre><code>The Group performed its annual impairment test in March 2024 on Goodwill generated from the acquisition of Multi Finance PLC.
The Group considered its net book value, among other factors, when reviewing indicators of impairment as at 31 March 2024. The
market price was not available since the trading of shares of Multi Finance PLC was suspended from 13 October 2022 indicating a
potential impairment of goodwill.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The recoverable amount of the investment in Multi Finance PLC as at 31 March 2024 has been determined based on a value in use
calculation using cash flow projections. It was concluded that the fair value less costs to sell did not exceed the value in use. As a
result of this analysis, management has recognised an impairment charge of Rs 107,803,189 in the current financial year against the
goodwill as at 31 March 2024. The amount recognised is recorded within impairment charges in the Income Statement.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>2.26 Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities</strong></p>
<pre><code>Accounting Policy
</code></pre>
<p>Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their<br>
carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences.</p>
<p>Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused<br>
tax losses (if any), to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary<br>
differences, and the unused tax credits and unused tax losses carried forward can be utilised.</p>
<p>Deferred tax assets / liabilities shall be recognised for temporary differences, unless it arises from the initial recognition of an<br>
asset or liability in a transaction that:<br>
 is not a business combination.<br>
 at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit (tax loss); and<br>
 at the time of the transaction, does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.</p>
<p>The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer<br>
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised<br>
deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that<br>
future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.</p>
<p>Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised<br>
or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting<br>
date. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets<br>
against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.</p>
<pre><code>Accounting Estimates
</code></pre>
<p>Deferred tax assets are recognised in respect of tax losses to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be<br>
available against which such tax losses can be utilised. Judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets<br>
that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profits, together with the future tax planning<br>
strategies.</p>

<pre><code>These include bank overdrafts, finance leases, syndicated loans, term loans, securitisation loans and other bank facilities. Due
to bank balances are initially recognised at fair value net of transactions cost. Subsequently, they are stated at amortised cost;
any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction cost) and the repayable amount (including interest) is recognised in
the Income Statement over the period of the loan using effective interest rate method.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Under finance leases, the leased assets are capitalised and included in ‘property, plant and equipment’ and the corresponding
liability to the lessor is included in ‘Due to Banks’. A finance lease and its corresponding liability are recognised initially at the
fair value of the asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments. Finance charges payable are recognised
in ‘Interest Expense’ over the period of the lease based on the interest rate implicit in the lease so as to give a constant rate of
interest on the remaining period of the liability.

non financial liabilities. Other non financial liabilities include accruals, advances and provisions. These liabilities are non-interest
bearing and recorded at the amounts that are expected to be paid.

<pre><code>Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, and it
is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the Income

<p><strong>2.33 Post Employement Benefit Liability</strong></p>
<p><strong>Accounting Estimates</strong></p>
<pre><code>Our end of service benefit obligations are measured based on the present value of projected future benefit payments for
all participants for services rendered to date. The measurement of projected future benefits is dependent on the stipulated
formula, salary assumptions, demographics of the Group covered by the plan, and other key measurement assumptions. The
net periodic benefit costs associated with the Group defined benefit plans are determined using assumptions regarding the
benefit obligations. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subjected to significant uncertainty. All
assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>In determining the appropriate discount rate, management considers the interest rates of Sri Lanka Government Bonds with
extrapolated maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the defined benefit obligation. The mortality rate is based
on publicly available mortality tables. Future salary increases are based on expected future inflation rates and expected future
salary increase rate of the Group.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Provision has been made for retirement gratuities from the beginning of service for all employees, in conformity with Sri Lanka
Accounting Standard LKAS 19 on ‘Employee Benefit’. However, under the Payment of Gratuity Act No. 12 of 1983, the liability to
an employee arises only on completion of five years of continued service.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Recognition of Actuarial Gains and Losses</strong></p>
<pre><code>The Group recognises the total actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating the Group obligation in respect of the plan in
Other Comprehensive Income during the period in which it occurs.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Expected Return on Assets</strong></p>
<pre><code>Expected return on assets is zero as the plan is not pre-funded.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Funding Arrangements</strong></p>
<pre><code>The gratuity liability is not externally funded.

<pre><code>Segmental Information
Accounting Policy An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components, whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources allocated to each segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. For management purposes, the Group is organised into four operating segments based on services offered and geographical operations as presented in the table below. Management monitors the operating results of its segments separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profits or losses. Income taxes are managed separately for the Company and its international operation and are allocated to operating segments.No revenue from transactions with a single external customer or counterparty amounted to 10% or more of the Company’s total revenue in 2024 or 2023.There were no transactions between reportable segments in 2024 or 2023.

As a financial institution engaged in a varied offerings of financial services, the Group is exposed to following key risks which
are inherent in its operations.
 Credit Risk
 Liquidity Risk
 Market Risk
 Operational Risk
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Proper management of these risks is essential for the Group’s sustainability and is crucial to all of its activities. To achieve
this, the risk management function aims to proactively identify potential risks, analyse them, and take preventive measures to
manage the risks on continuous basis, while maximising risk-adjusted returns within the Group’s risk appetite.

<h1 id="section-380">1 2 3 4 5 6 7</h1>
<h3 id="section-6-16">SECTION 6</h3>
<p>The Risk Management Framework of the Group has been optimised through the application and the embedment of the<br>
risk management process which includes risk identification, risk analysis, risk measurement, risk management decision and<br>
execution, risk monitoring and reporting.</p>
<pre><code>The overall responsibility of establishment and oversight of the Risk Management Framework of the Group is vested with the
Board of Directors. The Board Integrated Risk Management Committee (BIRMC), a sub committee appointed by the Board,
ensures that risk management strategies, policies and processes are in place to manage events/outcomes that could potentially
impact earnings, performance, reputation and capital.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The Management Committees, namely, Credit Committee, IT Steering and Security Committee, Sustainability Committee,
Business Continuity Management Committee, each with a defined responsibility, facilitate the effective functioning of risk
management framework by executing their respective risk management mandates. The adequacy and effectiveness of the
management committees is reviewed by the BIRMC annually.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Risk management policies, procedures and risk appetite statement are reviewed regularly to be inline with the risk
management capacities, business opportunities, Group’s business strategy and regulatory requirements. Internal controls are
a key element in the risk management framework. They ensure the integrity of financial and accounting information, promote
compliance and operational efficiency, and prevent fraud. Clearly defined procurers, continuous trainings and code of conduct
contribute to inculcate strong risk culture.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The Internal Audit department periodically carries out an independent review of the implementation of the risk management
framework and risk policies covering different risk categories.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Risk Management Department (RMD)</strong></p>
<pre><code>Whilst the business units bear primary responsibility for risk management, the Risk Management Department (RMD) acts as
the second line of defence, providing independent oversight. The Head of Risk Management leads the RMD, reporting directly
to the BIRMC. The RMD works in harmony with other control functions in the Group, such as Internal Audit, Compliance,
and Finance, which may uncover risk management issues. Each of these control functions has a unique focus, and overlap is
minimised to ensure that their approaches are complementary and lead to consistent, effective, and timely escalation of risks.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>4.2 Credit Risk</strong></p>
<pre><code>Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a borrower or counterparty to a financial instrument, fails to meet
its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s loans and advances to customers/other companies
and investments in debt securities. Credit risk constitutes the Group’s largest risk exposure category. This can be broadly
categorised into three types; default, concentration and settlement risk.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Default risk is the risk of the potential financial loss resulting from the failure of customer or counterparty to meet its debt or
contractual obligations and arises principally from the Group’s loans and advances to customers.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Concentration risk is the credit exposure being concentrated as a result of excessive build-up of exposure to a single
counterparty, industry, product, geographical location or insufficient diversification.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Settlement risk is the risk of loss arising from trading/investment activities when there is a mutual undertaking to deliver on a
progressive basis.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Managing Credit Risk</strong></p>
<pre><code>Group manages credit risk by focusing on following steps;
 The credit risk management initiates at the beginning of the loan origination stage which includes the preliminary screening
of the customer and credit appraisal of the particular facility. The objective of this process is to assess the borrower’s
ability to meet its obligations in an objective manner. Credit appraisal process is further strengthened by the credit risk
scoring model which assigns each individual facility a score based on the payment history, strength of the collaterals and
guarantors.
</code></pre>
<pre><code> The Group has clearly defined guidelines for credit approvals where the approval limits have been delegated taking into
consideration the factors such as maximum counterparty exposures, loan to value ratio and forced sale value.
</code></pre>
<pre><code> The Group uses collateral, where possible, to mitigate its risks on financial assets. The collateral comes in various forms
such as cash, vehicles, gold, securities, letters of guarantees, receivables, inventories and other non financial assets. The fair
value of collateral is generally assessed at the inception based on the guidelines issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and
the Central Bank of Myanmar.
</code></pre>
<pre><code> A comprehensive set of credit risk indicators are monitored monthly to review the credit quality of the portfolio, to avoid
undue concentration to products, regions and stress industry sectors and to ensure the compliance with regulatory and
prudent exposure limits that defines the risk appetite of the Group.
 Post disbursement monitoring and review is initially performed by the the Credit Department. Early warnings system on
problem loans is mainly based on the arrears position of the facilities. To address delinquencies, early and effective follow-
ups and reminders are implemented. For critical exposures, swift recovery actions are taken. If a loan becomes overdue
for a period that exceeds the tolerance period, responsibility for recovery and collections is transferred to the Recoveries
Department.
</code></pre>
<pre><code> Impairment assessment is based on a Expected Credit Loss (ECL) approach where the assessment models are validated by
independent external expertise. The methodology of the impairment assessment has been explained in the Note 2.18 to
these Financial Statements.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Management of Large Exposures
The Credit Committee is primarily responsible for implementing the overall credit policy set out by the Board of Directors.
This includes setting lending guidelines in conformity with the credit risk appetite set by the Board of Directors. Sanctioning of
large exposures are primarily handled by the Credit Committee. Further, it is responsible for managing credit default risk and
concentration risk. The Credit Committee consists of the Managing Director, Deputy Managing Director, Executive Directors,
Deputy General Manager-Credit, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Impact Assessment of Stressed Economic Conditions
The Group’s Integrated Risk Management Framework aims to proactively manage the impact of unfavourable economic and
market conditions while achieving the Company’s risk-return objectives. This has been demonstrated by the Group’s ability
to maintain a lower level of non-performing loans (NPLs) compared to the industry average (LFCs and SLCs). The Group has
always acted with due diligence and taken prudent measures to ensure effective and efficient repayment behaviour from credit
customers, while also safeguarding the interests of stakeholders.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>4.2.1 Analysis of Credit Risk Exposure
The fair value of collateral for finance receivables is calculated based on the number of contracts multiplied by the loss severity
and the Probability of Default (PD) percentage or the outstanding receivable balances multiplied by the Average Recovery Value
(ARV) percentage to determine the fair value adjustment.

<pre><code>4.3 Liquidity Risk and Funding Management
In the context of a financial institution, liquidity risk arises primarily due to mismatches in the maturity profile of assets and
liabilities. Liquidity risk for a financial institution can take two forms; market liquidity risk and funding liquidity risk.
Market liquidity risk is the inability to easily exit a position. Group’s market liquidity risk is low if assets can be liquidated
without moving the price too much.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Funding liquidity risk means the Group’s inability to finance assets continuously at an acceptable borrowing rate. Funding
liquidity risk generally arises when creditors either withdraw credit or change the terms on which it is granted in such a way
they are no longer profitable. Funding liquidity risk would increase if the Group’s credit quality is, or at least perceived to be,
deteriorating, but also because financial conditions as a whole are deteriorating.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Managing Liquidity Risk
The Group’s primary objective in liquidity risk management is to ensure adequate funding for its businesses throughout
market cycles, including periods of financial stress. To achieve this objective the Group regularly monitors liquidity position and
maintain an adequate buffer of liquid assets. Monitoring maturity mismatches of assets and liabilities and cashflow forecast
under normal and stress scenarios are two key tools used in the liquidity risk management process. All statutory and prudent
liquidity ratios are monitored against tolerance limits and stress testing is carried out regularly to assess the effectiveness
of liquidity management. The Group has taken prudent measures to increase its liquidity buffers and maintained a strong
excess liquidity position throughout the year under review. The Group is comfortable with its existing buffer of liquid assets.
Contingency funding planning serves as an action plan detailing the steps to take during liquidity shortfalls. Group maintains
access to diverse funding sources to meet unforeseen liquidity requirements.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>ALCO is primarily responsible for the effective management of assets and liabilities to minimise the maturity mismatch, there
by manage the liquidity risk of the Group. ALCO is chaired by the Managing Director and comprises of Deputy Managing
Director, Executive Directors, representatives from Treasury Department, Fixed Deposits, the Chief Financial Officer and
Chief Risk Officer. The Committee meets regularly and make all policy decisions with regard to funding matters, duration
management of assets and liabilities and investments, to keep the liquidity at healthy levels, whilst satisfying regulatory
requirements.

<p>4.4 Market Risk</p>
<pre><code>Market risk refers to the possible losses to the Group that could arise from changes in market variables such as interest rates,
exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control
market risk exposures within acceptable parameters to ensure the Group’s solvency while optimising the return on risk.
</code></pre>
<p>**4.4.1	 Interest	Rate	Risk	**</p>
<pre><code>Interest rate risk is a key constitute of the market risk exposure of the Group due to adverse and unanticipated movements in
future interest rate which arises from core business activities; disbursing of credit facilities, accepting deposits and issuing debt
instruments.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Due to the nature of operations of the Group, the impact of interest rate risk is mainly on the earnings of the Group rather
than the market value of portfolios.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Excessive movements in market interest rate could result in severe volatility to Group’s net interest income and net interest
margin. Group’s exposure to interest rate risk is primarily associated with factors such as;
</code></pre>
<pre><code> Reprising risk arising from a fixed rate borrowing portfolio, where reprising frequency is different to that of the lending
portfolio.
</code></pre>
<pre><code> Yield curve risk arising from unanticipated shifts of the market yield curve.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Interest rate risk is managed principally through minimising interest rate sensitive asset liability gaps. In order to ensure
interest rate margin and spreads are maintained, the Group conducts periodic reviews and reprices its assets accordingly.
During the year, under the declining interest rate environment, the Company ensured timely repricing of deposit liabilities,
following the market interest rate trend and strategically managed the downward pressure on the Net Interest Income by
reducing the cost of funds.

<pre><code>4.4.4 Commodity Price Risk
Commodity price risk refers to the uncertainties of future market values and of the size of the future income, caused by the
fluctuation in the prices of commodities. Given the significance of the Gold Loans business to Group’s overall loan book, sharp
fluctuations to the gold prices could have an adverse impact to earnings. Gold price fluctuations lead to market risk which is the
primary source of credit risk associated with this product.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Group currently manages the credit and market risks arising from adverse movements in gold prices by adopting the following
strategies;
</code></pre>
<pre><code> Shorter product life: Group, as a credit risk management strategy lends for shorter periods allowing it to initiate its recovery
process faster.
 Frequent revisions to Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio: Group practices a process of revising advance offered per gold sovereign to
reflect market value fluctuations to maintain the desired healthy Loan to Value Ratio.
</code></pre>
<pre><code> Timely auction of gold stocks : The gold stock of defaulted facilities are auctioned on frequent basis, avoiding pilling up of
gold stock which would lead to larger losses at a sudden drop in the gold prices.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Further, stress tests are carried out regularly to assess the impact at decline in gold prices in varied levels.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Value at Risk (VaR) model is used as a key tool to asses the maximum estimated loss that can arise with a specified probability
(confidence level) over a specified period of time due to adverse movement of gold price. The VaR model used is mainly on
historical simulation and the model generates a wide range of plausible future scenarios for market price movements.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>As at 31 March 2024 2023
</code></pre>
<pre><code>3 months VaR of Global Gold Price at 95% Confidence Level 9.64% 11.77%
3 months VaR of Exchange Rate at 95% Confidence Level 4.19% 13.02%
Expected Credit Loss (Rs. '000) 364,303 752,765
</code></pre>
<pre><code>4.4.5 Exchange Rate Risk
Exchange rate risk is the risk of loss as a result of unhedged exposure to volatility in the local (LKR) exchange rate with other
major currencies.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Group is exposed to two types of risk caused by currency volatility.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Transaction risk &nbsp;–This risk arises whenever the Group has contractual cash flows (receivables and payables) whose values are
subject to unanticipated changes in exchange rates due to a contract being denominated in a foreign currency. This type of
exposure is short-term to medium-term in nature.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The contractual payable in foreign currency is fully hedged through a cross currency swap and the Company is not exposed to
transaction foreign currency risk as at 31 March 2024.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Translation risk &nbsp;– This exposure arises from the effect of currency fluctuations on the consolidated financial statements,
particularly when it has foreign&nbsp;subsidiaries. This type of exposure is medium-term to long-term.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The Company’s exposure to Translation foreign currency risk is at a minimal level
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Further, exchange risk could materialize as an indirect risk too, affecting local gold prices resulting in exaggerated commodity
risk.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Exchange rate movement is closely monitored and asses the impact to local gold price. As presented in note 4.4.4 above, the
historical movement of exchange rate is considered in the VaR approach of the commodity risk assessment.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>4.4.6 Equity Price Risk
Equity price risk is the risk that the fair value of equities decreases as a result of changes in the levels of equity indices and the
value of individual stocks. The Equity risk exposure to the Group is at a minimal level.

<p><strong>4.5 Operational Risk</strong></p>
<pre><code>Operational risk is inherent in all the products, activities, processes and systems of the Company, and the effective
management of operational risk has always been a fundamental element of a Group’s risk management program. Operational
risk can arise from a wide range of different external events or internal events. A strong operational risk culture together with
robust internal controls, effective monitoring and internal reporting, contingency planning, clear strategies and oversight by the
Board of Directors and Senior Management are crucial elements of the effective Operational Risk Management Framework of
the Company.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Following tools are utilised to identify and assess the operational risk the Group is exposed to and they may also be utilised to
implement action plans and monitor their execution.
 Reporting, Collection and Analysis of Operational Risk Incidents and Loss Events
 Departmental Wise Qualitative Risk Identification
 Risk Appetite and Tolerance Levels for Operational Risk
 Exception Monitoring
 Regular Monitoring of Key Risk Indicator
 Risk and Control Self-Assessment on Fraud Risk
 Branch Operational Risk Assessment
</code></pre>
<p><strong>4.6 Capital Adequacy</strong></p>
<pre><code>For a financial institution, capital is a buffer against insolvency. It is available to absorb unforeseen losses which will assure the
sustainability of the Group’s operations so the Group can remain in business. The more capital the Group has relative to the
risks it takes, the more confidence the stakeholders are that it will meet its obligations to them. Group’s capital management
process is steered with the aim of holding sufficient capital to support the Group’s risk appetite whilst maintaining adequate
capital to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements. The capital goals of the Company are related to the effective capital
management. They focus on bringing a right balance between risk absorption capacity and return to shareholders.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The Company has acquired the majority stake of the Multi Finance PLC in line with the Consolidation Master Plan of Central
Bank of Sri Lanka on 16 March 2022. Multi Finance PLC is yet to comply with the minimum core capital requirements as required
by the Direction on 2 of 2017 - Minimum Core Capital. Currently, the Group management is in the process of completing the
amalgamation process as approved by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. Multi Finance PLC is in compliance with the Tier 1 Capital
ratio and Total Capital ratio (Capital Adequacy Requirements) as of 31 March 2024.

of regulatory capital adequacy assessment. Further, the Company has adopted the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment
Process (ICAAP) which is an integral part of Basel Framework. The capital consumption by pillar II risks is assessed under ICAAP
and capital augmentation is considered in line with the Company’s medium term corporate strategy.
